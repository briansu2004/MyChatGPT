## [Java] I have a Java spring boot project. I want to put a folder to contain some mock response files. Where I should put this folder?

In a Java Spring Boot project, you can put your mock response files in the src/test/resources directory. This directory is intended to hold non-production resources, such as test files and configuration files, which will not be included in the final packaged artifact.

Create a new folder under src/test/resources to hold your mock response files. For example, you could create a folder called mock_responses like this:

```bash
src/test/resources/mock_responses/
```

Once you have created the folder, you can place your mock response files inside it. You can then access these files from your test code using the appropriate resource loading methods provided by Spring Boot, such as ClasspathResource or FileSystemResource.

For example, if you have a file called mock_response.json in the mock_responses folder, you can load it using ClasspathResource like this:

```java
Resource resource = new ClasspathResource("mock_responses/mock_response.json");
InputStream inputStream = resource.getInputStream();
// Use the input stream to read the contents of the file
```

Note that the ClasspathResource method expects a path relative to the src/test/resources directory, so you don't need to include that part in the path.
