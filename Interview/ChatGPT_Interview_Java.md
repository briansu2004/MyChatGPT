## [Java] @NamedQuery

@NamedQuery is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to define a pre-defined query with a specific name. This named query can be then referenced in code to execute the query.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "User" and we want to retrieve all the users from the database whose age is greater than a certain value. We can define a named query using the @NamedQuery annotation as follows:

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name = "User.findByAgeGreaterThan", query = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age")
public class User {
    // Class definition
}
```

In this example, we have defined a named query with the name "User.findByAgeGreaterThan" and the actual query to be executed is "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age". We can now use this named query in our code to retrieve the required data as follows:

```java
TypedQuery<User> query = entityManager.createNamedQuery("User.findByAgeGreaterThan", User.class);
query.setParameter("age", 25);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

In this code snippet, we have created a TypedQuery object using the named query "User.findByAgeGreaterThan" and then set the value of the parameter "age" to 25. Finally, we have executed the query and obtained the result list.

## [Java] TypedQuery in Java

In Java Persistence API (JPA), TypedQuery is an interface that represents a compiled JPA query that returns a result of a specific type. TypedQuery provides type safety and allows you to define the expected result type of a query, so you can avoid runtime errors caused by incompatible data types.

To create a TypedQuery, you need to first define a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query string or use a named query that you have defined in your entity class or XML configuration. Then you can use the EntityManager instance to create the TypedQuery object by calling the createQuery or createNamedQuery method, respectively.

Here's an example of how to use TypedQuery to retrieve a list of users from the database:

```java
TypedQuery<User> query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age", User.class);
query.setParameter("age", 25);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

In this example, we have created a TypedQuery object with the expected result type of User. We used the createQuery method to create the TypedQuery object and passed the JPQL query string as the first parameter and the expected result type as the second parameter. We then set the value of the "age" parameter using the setParameter method and finally executed the query using the getResultList method, which returns a List<User>.

Note that if you use a named query, you can call the createNamedQuery method instead of createQuery and pass the name of the named query as the parameter. The rest of the code remains the same.

## [Java] @Temporal

@Temporal is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to map a Java date or time field to a corresponding database column of a specific temporal type. It allows you to specify how the date or time information should be stored in the database, whether as a DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "Event" that has a field for the start time of the event. We can use the @Temporal annotation to specify that this field should be stored as a TIMESTAMP in the database as follows:

```java
@Entity
public class Event {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    
    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date startTime;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, we have used the @Temporal annotation to specify that the startTime field should be stored as a TIMESTAMP in the database. We have passed the value TemporalType.TIMESTAMP as the parameter to the annotation, which specifies that the field should be stored as a Java.util.Date object with both date and time information.

Other options for the TemporalType parameter include TemporalType.DATE and TemporalType.TIME, which specify that the field should be stored as a DATE or TIME in the database, respectively.

By using the @Temporal annotation, we can ensure that the Java date or time object is stored in the database in the correct format and can be retrieved and manipulated correctly by our application.

## [Java] @Embeddable

@Embeddable is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to indicate that a class is an embeddable class. An embeddable class is a class whose instances are stored as part of the state of an entity, rather than as a separate entity in their own right. Embeddable classes are commonly used to group related fields together and to improve the organization and readability of the code.

To define an embeddable class, you must annotate it with the @Embeddable annotation. The class can then be used as a field in an entity class by annotating the field with the @Embedded annotation. The embedded class is mapped to the database table columns of the parent entity.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "Employee" that has an Address field which is an embeddable class:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    
    @Embedded
    private Address address;
    
    // getters and setters
}

@Embeddable
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipCode;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, we have defined an embeddable class Address with street, city, state, and zipCode fields. The Employee entity has an Address field annotated with the @Embedded annotation. This indicates that the Address object should be stored as part of the Employee object in the same table.

By using the @Embeddable and @Embedded annotations, we can group related fields together and create a more organized and modular code structure. Additionally, this allows us to avoid having to create separate tables for every field, which can improve the performance of our application.

## [Java] Java annotation @Entity

In Java, the @Entity annotation is used to mark a class as an entity or a table in a relational database.

When a class is marked with the @Entity annotation, it becomes a persistent class, meaning that instances of the class can be saved to and retrieved from a database. The entity class typically corresponds to a table in the database, with the class fields corresponding to the columns of the table.

Here's an example of how the @Entity annotation can be used in a Java class definition:

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the Customer class is marked with the @Entity annotation to indicate that it is an entity class. The @Id annotation is also used to indicate that the id field is the primary key of the corresponding table in the database.

With this annotation, the class can be used with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework such as Hibernate to interact with the database without having to write SQL queries directly.

## [Java] Java annotation @Column

In Java, the @Column annotation is used to specify the mapping between a Java class field and a database table column when using Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools such as Hibernate or Java Persistence API (JPA).

This annotation can be used to customize the name, length, precision, and other properties of the corresponding database column. Here's an example of using the @Column annotation:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "person")
public class Person {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  @Column(name = "first_name", nullable = false, length = 50)
  private String firstName;

  @Column(name = "last_name", nullable = false, length = 50)
  private String lastName;

  // constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

In this example, the @Column annotation is used to specify that the firstName and lastName fields of the Person class should be mapped to the first_name and last_name columns of the person table in the database. Additionally, the nullable attribute is set to false to indicate that these columns cannot be null, and the length attribute is set to 50 to specify the maximum length of these columns.

Overall, the @Column annotation is a powerful tool that allows developers to fine-tune the mapping between Java objects and database tables.

## [Java] What are the typical steps for a new java spring boot app?

Here are the typical steps for creating a new Java Spring Boot application:

```dos
Set up your development environment: Before you start creating a new Spring Boot application, you need to set up your development environment. This involves installing Java, Maven or Gradle, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a new Spring Boot project: You can create a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr web interface or the command-line interface. The Spring Initializr allows you to select the required dependencies and generate a project with a pre-configured structure.

Add required dependencies: Once you have created the project, you may need to add additional dependencies required for your specific project. This can be done in the pom.xml or build.gradle file.

Write code: With the project set up and dependencies added, you can start writing code for your application. The code typically includes the main class, controllers, services, and repositories.

Run the application: Once you have written your code, you can run your Spring Boot application to ensure that everything is working as expected. This can be done from the command line or from within your IDE.

Package the application: Once you have verified that your application is working as expected, you can package it as a JAR or WAR file. This can be done using the Maven or Gradle build tool.

Deploy the application: Finally, you can deploy your application to a production environment such as a server or a cloud-based platform like AWS or Google Cloud.
```

## [Java] @NoArgsConstructor @AllArgsConstructor

@NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor are annotations used in Java to generate constructors for classes.

@NoArgsConstructor is used to generate a no-argument constructor for a class. This constructor can be useful when you need to create an instance of the class without passing any arguments. This annotation can be particularly useful when working with frameworks like Spring that require a no-argument constructor for certain operations.

Example usage:

```java
@NoArgsConstructor
public class MyClass {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  // ... other fields and methods
}
```

@AllArgsConstructor is used to generate a constructor that takes arguments for all of the class's fields. This can be useful when you need to create an instance of the class with all of its fields initialized.

Example usage:

```java
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MyClass {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  // ... other fields and methods
}
```

In both cases, the annotations generate the corresponding constructor at compile time. If you need to customize the generated constructors, you can use additional annotations and annotations arguments.

## [Java] @Data vs lombok

@Data and Lombok are two Java libraries that help to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written for Java classes. Here's a brief comparison of the two:

@Data is a feature of the Project Lombok library that automatically generates getters and setters, equals and hashCode methods, and a toString method for a Java class. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written for simple data classes. Additionally, it provides other annotations like @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor to automatically generate constructors.

Lombok, on the other hand, is a comprehensive library that provides many annotations to reduce boilerplate code. Apart from @Data, it also provides annotations like @Getter and @Setter to generate only getters or setters, @Builder to generate builder methods, @Slf4j to generate logger fields, and many more.

The advantage of using Lombok over just @Data is that it provides more flexibility in the code generation process. For example, you can use @Getter and @Setter to generate only getters or setters for specific fields, rather than generating them for all fields in the class. Additionally, Lombok provides better support for code refactoring tools and IDEs.

However, one potential disadvantage of using Lombok is that it introduces a new library dependency into your project, which may increase the size of your final artifact. Additionally, the code generated by Lombok may be less intuitive for developers who are not familiar with the library.

In summary, both @Data and Lombok can help to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes. If you only need to generate basic getters and setters, @Data is a good choice. However, if you need more flexibility in the code generation process or want to use other features provided by Lombok, it may be worth considering the library.

## [Java] @EnableJpaRepositories

@EnableJpaRepositories is an annotation in Spring Framework that is used to enable JPA repositories in your application. When you annotate a configuration class with @EnableJpaRepositories, Spring Framework will scan for interfaces that extend the JpaRepository interface and create instances of them as Spring beans.

Here's an example of how to use the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation in Spring Framework:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "com.example.repository")
public class MyConfiguration {
  // Other configuration code
}
```

In this example, the MyConfiguration class is annotated with @Configuration, which indicates that it is a Spring configuration class. It is also annotated with @EnableJpaRepositories, which enables JPA repositories in the application. The basePackages attribute of the annotation specifies the package(s) in which Spring Framework should scan for JPA repositories. In this case, it is set to "com.example.repository", so Spring Framework will scan that package and any of its sub-packages for JPA repositories.

Once you have enabled JPA repositories using @EnableJpaRepositories, you can create repository interfaces that extend the JpaRepository interface and use them to interact with the database. Spring Framework will automatically create instances of these repository interfaces as Spring beans and inject them into other components as needed.

Note that @EnableJpaRepositories can also be used to specify other configuration options, such as the name of the EntityManagerFactory bean to use or the name of the transaction manager bean to use. Additionally, you can use the @Repository annotation on a repository interface to indicate that it is a repository component, although this is not strictly necessary when using @EnableJpaRepositories.

## [Java] @Configuration

@Configuration is an annotation in Spring Framework that is used to indicate that a class is a configuration class. Configuration classes define beans and other Spring-related configuration, such as database connections, thread pools, and message queues.

When you annotate a class with @Configuration, Spring Framework will automatically detect it and use it to create and configure beans in the application context. Configuration classes can also be used to define bean dependencies and to configure other parts of the Spring application context, such as transaction management and security.

Here's an example of how to use the @Configuration annotation in Spring Framework:

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
  @Bean
  public MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBean();
  }

  // Other bean definitions and configuration methods
}
```

In this example, the MyConfiguration class is annotated with @Configuration, indicating that it is a configuration class. The class also has a method, myBean(), that is annotated with @Bean. This method defines a bean of type MyBean and returns an instance of it. When the application context is created, Spring Framework will detect the MyConfiguration class and call its methods to create and configure beans in the context.

Note that @Configuration can also be used with other annotations, such as @Import and @ComponentScan, to import configuration from other classes or to scan for components in the application. Additionally, @Configuration classes can be used to define other configuration options, such as database connections and transaction management.

## [Java] @Service

@Service is an annotation in Spring Framework that is used to indicate that a class is a service component. Service components are typically used to encapsulate business logic or other application functionality that is not related to data access or web presentation.

When you annotate a class with @Service, Spring Framework will automatically detect it and create an instance of the class as a Spring bean. You can then use the service component in other parts of your application, such as controllers or other service components, by injecting it using the @Autowired annotation.

Here's an example of how to use the @Service annotation in Spring Framework:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
  public void doSomething() {
    // Business logic here
  }
}
```

In this example, the MyService class is annotated with @Service, indicating that it is a service component. The class has a method, doSomething(), that encapsulates business logic or other application functionality. When the application context is created, Spring Framework will detect the MyService class and create an instance of it as a Spring bean. You can then use the service component in other parts of your application by injecting it using the @Autowired annotation.

Note that @Service can also be used with other annotations, such as @Transactional, to indicate that the service component should be wrapped in a transaction. Additionally, you can use the @Component annotation to indicate that a class is a general-purpose Spring component, although @Service is preferred for service components to make their purpose more explicit.

## [Java] Spring @Qualifier

In Spring Framework, the @Qualifier annotation is used to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple beans of the same type. When you annotate a field or parameter with @Qualifier and provide the name of a bean, Spring Framework will inject the bean with that name into the field or parameter.

Here's an example of how to use the @Qualifier annotation in Spring Framework:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
  @Autowired
  @Qualifier("myRepository1")
  private MyRepository myRepository;

  // Service methods that use MyRepository
}
```

In this example, the MyService class is annotated with @Service, which indicates that it is a service component. The class also has a field, myRepository, that is annotated with both @Autowired and @Qualifier. The @Autowired annotation tells Spring Framework to inject an instance of the MyRepository type into the field, and the @Qualifier annotation specifies that it should use the bean with the name "myRepository1".

You can also use @Qualifier on constructor parameters or setter methods, in which case Spring Framework will use constructor or setter injection to create the instance of the class. Additionally, you can use @Qualifier with @Bean methods to specify which bean to create when there are multiple beans of the same type.

Note that @Qualifier is often used in conjunction with other Spring annotations, such as @Autowired, @Component, and @Repository, to provide more fine-grained control over bean injection and configuration.

## [Java] A better example of @Qualifier

Sure! Here's an example that demonstrates how @Qualifier can be used to resolve an ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present in the Spring container:

Suppose you have two implementations of a UserService interface:

```java
public interface UserService {
    void saveUser(User user);
}

@Service("userService1")
public class UserServiceImpl1 implements UserService {
    @Override
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        // Implementation specific to UserServiceImpl1
    }
}

@Service("userService2")
public class UserServiceImpl2 implements UserService {
    @Override
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        // Implementation specific to UserServiceImpl2
    }
}
```

Both implementations have been annotated with @Service, which registers them as Spring beans. If you want to inject one of these beans into another component, you can use @Qualifier to disambiguate between them. Here's an example:

```java
@Service
public class UserRegistrationService {
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("userService1")
    private UserService userService;

    public void registerUser(User user) {
        userService.saveUser(user);
    }
}
```

In this example, UserRegistrationService has a dependency on UserService, but there are two beans of type UserService in the Spring container. To specify which one to use, we've added the @Qualifier annotation to the userService field, with a value of "userService1". This tells Spring to inject the bean with the ID "userService1", which is an instance of UserServiceImpl1.

Using @Qualifier can be particularly useful when you have multiple implementations of the same interface, and you need to specify which one to use in a particular context. Without @Qualifier, Spring would not be able to determine which bean to inject and would throw an exception.
