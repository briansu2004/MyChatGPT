## [Java] @NamedQuery

@NamedQuery is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to define a pre-defined query with a specific name. This named query can be then referenced in code to execute the query.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "User" and we want to retrieve all the users from the database whose age is greater than a certain value. We can define a named query using the @NamedQuery annotation as follows:

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name = "User.findByAgeGreaterThan", query = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age")
public class User {
    // Class definition
}
```

In this example, we have defined a named query with the name "User.findByAgeGreaterThan" and the actual query to be executed is "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age". We can now use this named query in our code to retrieve the required data as follows:

```java
TypedQuery<User> query = entityManager.createNamedQuery("User.findByAgeGreaterThan", User.class);
query.setParameter("age", 25);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

In this code snippet, we have created a TypedQuery object using the named query "User.findByAgeGreaterThan" and then set the value of the parameter "age" to 25. Finally, we have executed the query and obtained the result list.

## [Java] TypedQuery in Java

In Java Persistence API (JPA), TypedQuery is an interface that represents a compiled JPA query that returns a result of a specific type. TypedQuery provides type safety and allows you to define the expected result type of a query, so you can avoid runtime errors caused by incompatible data types.

To create a TypedQuery, you need to first define a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query string or use a named query that you have defined in your entity class or XML configuration. Then you can use the EntityManager instance to create the TypedQuery object by calling the createQuery or createNamedQuery method, respectively.

Here's an example of how to use TypedQuery to retrieve a list of users from the database:

```java
TypedQuery<User> query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age", User.class);
query.setParameter("age", 25);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

In this example, we have created a TypedQuery object with the expected result type of User. We used the createQuery method to create the TypedQuery object and passed the JPQL query string as the first parameter and the expected result type as the second parameter. We then set the value of the "age" parameter using the setParameter method and finally executed the query using the getResultList method, which returns a List<User>.

Note that if you use a named query, you can call the createNamedQuery method instead of createQuery and pass the name of the named query as the parameter. The rest of the code remains the same.

## [Java] @Temporal

@Temporal is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to map a Java date or time field to a corresponding database column of a specific temporal type. It allows you to specify how the date or time information should be stored in the database, whether as a DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "Event" that has a field for the start time of the event. We can use the @Temporal annotation to specify that this field should be stored as a TIMESTAMP in the database as follows:

```java
@Entity
public class Event {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    
    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date startTime;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, we have used the @Temporal annotation to specify that the startTime field should be stored as a TIMESTAMP in the database. We have passed the value TemporalType.TIMESTAMP as the parameter to the annotation, which specifies that the field should be stored as a Java.util.Date object with both date and time information.

Other options for the TemporalType parameter include TemporalType.DATE and TemporalType.TIME, which specify that the field should be stored as a DATE or TIME in the database, respectively.

By using the @Temporal annotation, we can ensure that the Java date or time object is stored in the database in the correct format and can be retrieved and manipulated correctly by our application.
