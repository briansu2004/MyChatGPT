## [Java] @NamedQuery

@NamedQuery is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to define a pre-defined query with a specific name. This named query can be then referenced in code to execute the query.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "User" and we want to retrieve all the users from the database whose age is greater than a certain value. We can define a named query using the @NamedQuery annotation as follows:

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name = "User.findByAgeGreaterThan", query = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age")
public class User {
    // Class definition
}
```

In this example, we have defined a named query with the name "User.findByAgeGreaterThan" and the actual query to be executed is "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age". We can now use this named query in our code to retrieve the required data as follows:

```java
TypedQuery<User> query = entityManager.createNamedQuery("User.findByAgeGreaterThan", User.class);
query.setParameter("age", 25);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

In this code snippet, we have created a TypedQuery object using the named query "User.findByAgeGreaterThan" and then set the value of the parameter "age" to 25. Finally, we have executed the query and obtained the result list.

## [Java] TypedQuery in Java

In Java Persistence API (JPA), TypedQuery is an interface that represents a compiled JPA query that returns a result of a specific type. TypedQuery provides type safety and allows you to define the expected result type of a query, so you can avoid runtime errors caused by incompatible data types.

To create a TypedQuery, you need to first define a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query string or use a named query that you have defined in your entity class or XML configuration. Then you can use the EntityManager instance to create the TypedQuery object by calling the createQuery or createNamedQuery method, respectively.

Here's an example of how to use TypedQuery to retrieve a list of users from the database:

```java
TypedQuery<User> query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age > :age", User.class);
query.setParameter("age", 25);
List<User> users = query.getResultList();
```

In this example, we have created a TypedQuery object with the expected result type of User. We used the createQuery method to create the TypedQuery object and passed the JPQL query string as the first parameter and the expected result type as the second parameter. We then set the value of the "age" parameter using the setParameter method and finally executed the query using the getResultList method, which returns a List<User>.

Note that if you use a named query, you can call the createNamedQuery method instead of createQuery and pass the name of the named query as the parameter. The rest of the code remains the same.

## [Java] @Temporal

@Temporal is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to map a Java date or time field to a corresponding database column of a specific temporal type. It allows you to specify how the date or time information should be stored in the database, whether as a DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "Event" that has a field for the start time of the event. We can use the @Temporal annotation to specify that this field should be stored as a TIMESTAMP in the database as follows:

```java
@Entity
public class Event {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    
    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date startTime;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, we have used the @Temporal annotation to specify that the startTime field should be stored as a TIMESTAMP in the database. We have passed the value TemporalType.TIMESTAMP as the parameter to the annotation, which specifies that the field should be stored as a Java.util.Date object with both date and time information.

Other options for the TemporalType parameter include TemporalType.DATE and TemporalType.TIME, which specify that the field should be stored as a DATE or TIME in the database, respectively.

By using the @Temporal annotation, we can ensure that the Java date or time object is stored in the database in the correct format and can be retrieved and manipulated correctly by our application.

## [Java] @Embeddable

@Embeddable is a JPA (Java Persistence API) annotation that is used to indicate that a class is an embeddable class. An embeddable class is a class whose instances are stored as part of the state of an entity, rather than as a separate entity in their own right. Embeddable classes are commonly used to group related fields together and to improve the organization and readability of the code.

To define an embeddable class, you must annotate it with the @Embeddable annotation. The class can then be used as a field in an entity class by annotating the field with the @Embedded annotation. The embedded class is mapped to the database table columns of the parent entity.

For example, consider a case where we have a JPA entity named "Employee" that has an Address field which is an embeddable class:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    
    @Embedded
    private Address address;
    
    // getters and setters
}

@Embeddable
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipCode;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, we have defined an embeddable class Address with street, city, state, and zipCode fields. The Employee entity has an Address field annotated with the @Embedded annotation. This indicates that the Address object should be stored as part of the Employee object in the same table.

By using the @Embeddable and @Embedded annotations, we can group related fields together and create a more organized and modular code structure. Additionally, this allows us to avoid having to create separate tables for every field, which can improve the performance of our application.

## [Java] Java annotation @Entity

In Java, the @Entity annotation is used to mark a class as an entity or a table in a relational database.

When a class is marked with the @Entity annotation, it becomes a persistent class, meaning that instances of the class can be saved to and retrieved from a database. The entity class typically corresponds to a table in the database, with the class fields corresponding to the columns of the table.

Here's an example of how the @Entity annotation can be used in a Java class definition:

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the Customer class is marked with the @Entity annotation to indicate that it is an entity class. The @Id annotation is also used to indicate that the id field is the primary key of the corresponding table in the database.

With this annotation, the class can be used with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework such as Hibernate to interact with the database without having to write SQL queries directly.

## [Java] Java annotation @Column

In Java, the @Column annotation is used to specify the mapping between a Java class field and a database table column when using Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools such as Hibernate or Java Persistence API (JPA).

This annotation can be used to customize the name, length, precision, and other properties of the corresponding database column. Here's an example of using the @Column annotation:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "person")
public class Person {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  @Column(name = "first_name", nullable = false, length = 50)
  private String firstName;

  @Column(name = "last_name", nullable = false, length = 50)
  private String lastName;

  // constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

In this example, the @Column annotation is used to specify that the firstName and lastName fields of the Person class should be mapped to the first_name and last_name columns of the person table in the database. Additionally, the nullable attribute is set to false to indicate that these columns cannot be null, and the length attribute is set to 50 to specify the maximum length of these columns.

Overall, the @Column annotation is a powerful tool that allows developers to fine-tune the mapping between Java objects and database tables.

## [Java] What are the typical steps for a new java spring boot app?

Here are the typical steps for creating a new Java Spring Boot application:

```dos
Set up your development environment: Before you start creating a new Spring Boot application, you need to set up your development environment. This involves installing Java, Maven or Gradle, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a new Spring Boot project: You can create a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr web interface or the command-line interface. The Spring Initializr allows you to select the required dependencies and generate a project with a pre-configured structure.

Add required dependencies: Once you have created the project, you may need to add additional dependencies required for your specific project. This can be done in the pom.xml or build.gradle file.

Write code: With the project set up and dependencies added, you can start writing code for your application. The code typically includes the main class, controllers, services, and repositories.

Run the application: Once you have written your code, you can run your Spring Boot application to ensure that everything is working as expected. This can be done from the command line or from within your IDE.

Package the application: Once you have verified that your application is working as expected, you can package it as a JAR or WAR file. This can be done using the Maven or Gradle build tool.

Deploy the application: Finally, you can deploy your application to a production environment such as a server or a cloud-based platform like AWS or Google Cloud.
```

## [Java] @NoArgsConstructor @AllArgsConstructor

@NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor are annotations used in Java to generate constructors for classes.

@NoArgsConstructor is used to generate a no-argument constructor for a class. This constructor can be useful when you need to create an instance of the class without passing any arguments. This annotation can be particularly useful when working with frameworks like Spring that require a no-argument constructor for certain operations.

Example usage:

```java
@NoArgsConstructor
public class MyClass {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  // ... other fields and methods
}
```

@AllArgsConstructor is used to generate a constructor that takes arguments for all of the class's fields. This can be useful when you need to create an instance of the class with all of its fields initialized.

Example usage:

```java
@AllArgsConstructor
public class MyClass {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  // ... other fields and methods
}
```

In both cases, the annotations generate the corresponding constructor at compile time. If you need to customize the generated constructors, you can use additional annotations and annotations arguments.
