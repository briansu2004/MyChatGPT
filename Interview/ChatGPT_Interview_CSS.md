What is CSS, and what is its role in web development?
Answer: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language that is used to describe the visual appearance of HTML and XML documents. CSS is used to separate presentation from content, allowing web designers to control the layout, typography, and color of web pages.

What are the different types of selectors in CSS?

Each element is treated as a rectangular box, and the size of the box is determined by its content, padding, border, and margin. The box model is important because it affects the layout of the page and the spacing between elements.

What is responsive design, and how do you achieve it with CSS?
Answer: Responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to create web pages that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This is achieved using CSS media queries, which allow you to specify different styles for different devices and screen sizes.

What are CSS frameworks, and how do they help in web development?
Answer: CSS frameworks are pre-written sets of CSS code that can be used to style web pages. They often include pre-built components and layouts that can be used to create websites quickly and easily. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation are widely used in web development.

What are CSS preprocessors, and how do they work?
Answer: CSS preprocessors are tools that extend the functionality of CSS by adding features such as variables, mixins, and functions. They work by processing the preprocessor code and outputting standard CSS that can be used in web development. Popular CSS preprocessors include Sass, Less, and Stylus.

How do you optimize CSS for performance?
Answer: To optimize CSS for performance, you can minimize the number of HTTP requests, reduce the size of CSS files, use media queries to load styles only when they are needed, and avoid using inline styles. You can also use CSS frameworks and preprocessors to reduce the amount of CSS code that needs to be written.

## [CSS] [SCSS] SCSS interview questions

Here are some SCSS (Sass) interview questions that you may encounter:

```dos
What is SCSS, and why is it used?
SCSS (Sass) is a CSS preprocessor that adds additional functionality to traditional CSS. It allows developers to write more concise and maintainable code by using variables, mixins, and other advanced features.
What is the difference between SCSS and Sass?
Sass is a syntax for writing CSS, while SCSS is a newer syntax that is more similar to traditional CSS. SCSS uses curly braces and semicolons like CSS, while Sass uses indentation and doesn't require semicolons.
What are variables in SCSS, and how are they used?
Variables are used to store and reuse values such as colors, font sizes, and spacing. They are defined using the $ symbol and can be used throughout your SCSS code.
What are mixins in SCSS, and how are they used?
Mixins are a way to define reusable chunks of code that can be included in multiple styles. They are defined using the @mixin keyword and can be used to apply a group of styles to an element.
What is nesting in SCSS, and how is it used?
Nesting is a way to write CSS selectors inside other selectors to create more specific styles. It can help make your SCSS code more organized and easier to read.
What is inheritance in SCSS, and how is it used?
Inheritance is a way to apply the styles of one selector to another selector. It can help reduce code duplication and make your SCSS code more efficient.
What are functions in SCSS, and how are they used?
Functions are used to perform calculations and transformations on values in your SCSS code. They can be used to create more dynamic and flexible styles.
What is the SCSS @import rule, and how is it used?
The @import rule is used to include other SCSS files in your code. It can help you organize your code into smaller, more manageable files.
What is the difference between SCSS and CSS specificity?
SCSS uses nesting and inheritance to create more specific CSS selectors, while CSS specificity relies on the order and specificity of the selector itself.
What are SCSS maps, and how are they used?
SCSS maps are used to store related values such as color schemes or font families. They can be used to simplify your code and make it more maintainable.
