## [Test] What is the pattern to make the unit test better?

There are many patterns and best practices that can help you make your unit tests better. Here are a few general patterns to keep in mind:

```dos
Use the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert. This pattern involves separating your test into three parts: first, arrange the data and objects needed for the test; then, act on the system under test; finally, assert that the expected results have been produced. This helps to make your tests more readable and easier to maintain.

Test only one thing at a time. Each unit test should focus on testing one specific piece of functionality. This makes it easier to isolate and debug problems when they arise.

Use meaningful names for your tests. A good test name should describe the behavior being tested and the expected outcome. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of the test and quickly identify any failures.

Make your tests repeatable and deterministic. Your tests should produce the same results every time they are run, regardless of the environment or the order in which they are executed.

Use mocking and stubbing to isolate dependencies. If your unit test has dependencies on external systems or components, use mocking and stubbing to isolate those dependencies and focus on testing the specific behavior of your system under test.

Keep your tests fast and lightweight. Unit tests should be quick to run, so that they can be executed frequently as part of a continuous integration process. Avoid expensive operations such as file I/O or network calls in your tests.

Refactor your tests regularly. Just like your production code, your tests should be refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Use code reviews and other feedback mechanisms to ensure that your tests are of high quality.

By following these patterns and best practices, you can create unit tests that are more reliable, maintainable, and effective at catching bugs and regressions.
