Here are some common Maven interview questions:

```dos
What is Maven?
Maven is a popular build automation tool for Java applications. It provides a simple way to manage project dependencies, build and package applications, and run tests.

What is a POM file in Maven?
A POM (Project Object Model) file is an XML file that defines a Maven project. It includes information about the project, such as its dependencies, build settings, and other configuration options.

What is a Maven artifact?
A Maven artifact is a packaged version of a project that can be deployed to a repository. It includes the compiled code, along with other files such as configuration files, documentation, and resources.

What is a Maven repository?
A Maven repository is a central location where Maven artifacts are stored and can be accessed by other projects. There are two types of repositories: local and remote. A local repository is stored on the developer's machine, while a remote repository is hosted on a server.

What is a Maven plugin?
A Maven plugin is a piece of code that extends the functionality of Maven. It can be used to perform tasks such as compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application.

What is the difference between clean and package goals in Maven?
The clean goal deletes the target directory, which contains the compiled code and other generated files. The package goal compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.

What is the difference between a snapshot and a release version in Maven?
A snapshot version is a version of a project that is still in development and may change frequently. A release version is a stable version of a project that is ready for deployment.

What is a Maven archetype?
A Maven archetype is a template for a Maven project. It includes a predefined project structure, along with configuration files, dependencies, and other settings.

What is the Maven lifecycle?
The Maven lifecycle is a sequence of phases that are executed when building a project. The phases include validate, compile, test, package, verify, install, and deploy.

How do you run tests in Maven?
To run tests in Maven, you can use the command "mvn test". This will compile the code, run the tests, and generate a report of the results. You can also specify a specific test or test suite to run with the "-Dtest" option.
