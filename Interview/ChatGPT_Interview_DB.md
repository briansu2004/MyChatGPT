## [DB] RDBMS vs NOSQL

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems. RDBMS is a traditional type of database management system that uses a relational data model, while NoSQL is a newer type of database management system that uses a non-relational data model. Here are some differences between the two:

```dos
Data model: RDBMS uses a tabular data model where data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and the relationship between tables is established through foreign keys. On the other hand, NoSQL uses various data models such as document, key-value, graph, or column-family.

Scalability: RDBMS is vertically scalable, which means it can handle increasing loads by adding more processing power and memory to the existing system. NoSQL is horizontally scalable, which means it can handle increasing loads by adding more nodes to the existing system.

Query language: RDBMS uses SQL (Structured Query Language) as its primary query language, while NoSQL has its own query languages such as MongoDB Query Language or Cassandra Query Language.

Data consistency: RDBMS maintains strong data consistency, which means all data is consistent and up-to-date at all times. NoSQL, on the other hand, sacrifices some consistency for scalability, which means there may be eventual consistency or eventual data loss.

Flexibility: NoSQL is more flexible than RDBMS, as it can handle unstructured and semi-structured data, whereas RDBMS can only handle structured data.

Use cases: RDBMS is suitable for applications that require high data consistency and transactional integrity, such as financial applications or inventory management systems. NoSQL is suitable for applications that require high scalability, such as social media or IoT applications.
```

In conclusion, both RDBMS and NoSQL have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the application.

## [DB] MongoDB Query Language

MongoDB Query Language is a query language used to retrieve data from MongoDB databases, which is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database. MongoDB Query Language (MQL) is designed to work with the document-based data model of MongoDB and provides a flexible way to query and manipulate data stored in MongoDB.

Some of the key features of MongoDB Query Language include:

```dos
Querying and Filtering: MQL provides a rich set of operators to query and filter data based on specific criteria, such as equality, comparison, logical, and regular expression operators.

Aggregation: MQL also supports aggregation operations, which allow users to perform complex calculations on large data sets, such as grouping, summing, averaging, and sorting.

Indexing: MQL supports the creation of indexes on one or more fields of a collection to optimize query performance.

Full-text search: MQL also supports full-text search, which allows users to search for text-based data within the database.

Geospatial queries: MQL supports geospatial queries, which allow users to query data based on geographic location.

Data manipulation: MQL also provides operators to manipulate data in the database, such as updating, deleting, and inserting documents.
```

Overall, MongoDB Query Language provides a powerful and flexible way to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data in MongoDB databases. Its rich set of operators and features make it a popular choice for developers working with MongoDB.
