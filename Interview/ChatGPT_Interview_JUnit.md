## [JUnit] JUnit interview questions

Here are some common JUnit interview questions:

```dos
What is JUnit?
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java applications. It provides a simple way to write and run unit tests for Java code.

What are the benefits of using JUnit?
JUnit provides several benefits, including:

The ability to test code in isolation
The ability to catch bugs early in the development process
The ability to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality
The ability to improve the overall quality and reliability of the code.
What is a test fixture in JUnit?
A test fixture is the preparation needed to run a test. It includes any setup code needed to create objects or initialize variables that will be used in the test.

What is a test suite in JUnit?
A test suite is a collection of test cases that can be run together. It can include multiple classes and methods, and provides a way to organize tests and run them all at once.

What is a test runner in JUnit?
A test runner is a tool that runs JUnit tests and reports the results. It provides a way to execute tests and generate reports that show which tests passed, which failed, and why.

What is the difference between @Before and @BeforeClass annotations in JUnit?
@Before is an annotation that is used to indicate that a method should be run before each test method. @BeforeClass is used to indicate that a method should be run once before all the test methods in a class. The @BeforeClass method must be declared static.

What is the difference between @After and @AfterClass annotations in JUnit?
@After is an annotation that is used to indicate that a method should be run after each test method. @AfterClass is used to indicate that a method should be run once after all the test methods in a class. The @AfterClass method must be declared static.

What is a parameterized test in JUnit?
A parameterized test is a test that is run multiple times with different parameters. It is useful when you want to test a method with a range of values to ensure that it behaves correctly in all cases.

How do you ignore a test in JUnit?
To ignore a test in JUnit, you can use the @Ignore annotation. This will cause the test to be skipped when the test suite is run.

How do you test for an exception in JUnit?
To test for an exception in JUnit, you can use the @Test(expected=Exception.class) annotation. This will cause the test to pass if the specified exception is thrown during the test. Alternatively, you can use the ExpectedException rule to test for exceptions in more complex scenarios.
