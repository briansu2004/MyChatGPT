## [Struts] What is Struts and how does it work?

Struts is a popular open-source web application framework for developing Java-based enterprise applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and is designed to simplify the development of web applications by providing a set of tools and APIs.

Here is how Struts works:

```dos
Request Handling: When a user requests a web page, the request is first intercepted by the Struts framework. Struts then forwards the request to the appropriate Action class.

Action Class: The Action class receives the request and processes it by interacting with the Model (business logic) and populating the necessary data into the View (presentation layer).

View: The View is responsible for presenting the processed data to the user. Struts uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Velocity templates to generate the HTML output.

Struts Tag Library: Struts comes with a set of custom tags that can be used in JSP pages to simplify the presentation of data. These tags provide a consistent look and feel across the application.

Struts Configuration: Struts uses a configuration file to map incoming requests to the appropriate Action classes. This file also defines the global properties and settings for the application.

Interceptors: Struts provides a mechanism called Interceptors to intercept the request and response objects. This allows you to perform pre and post-processing tasks such as logging, security checks, and error handling.

Validation: Struts includes built-in support for validating user input, which helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
```

Overall, Struts provides a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It provides a well-defined structure and clear separation of concerns, which makes it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.
