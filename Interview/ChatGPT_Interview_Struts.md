## [Struts] What is Struts and how does it work?

Struts is a popular open-source web application framework for developing Java-based enterprise applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and is designed to simplify the development of web applications by providing a set of tools and APIs.

Here is how Struts works:

```dos
Request Handling: When a user requests a web page, the request is first intercepted by the Struts framework. Struts then forwards the request to the appropriate Action class.

Action Class: The Action class receives the request and processes it by interacting with the Model (business logic) and populating the necessary data into the View (presentation layer).

View: The View is responsible for presenting the processed data to the user. Struts uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Velocity templates to generate the HTML output.

Struts Tag Library: Struts comes with a set of custom tags that can be used in JSP pages to simplify the presentation of data. These tags provide a consistent look and feel across the application.

Struts Configuration: Struts uses a configuration file to map incoming requests to the appropriate Action classes. This file also defines the global properties and settings for the application.

Interceptors: Struts provides a mechanism called Interceptors to intercept the request and response objects. This allows you to perform pre and post-processing tasks such as logging, security checks, and error handling.

Validation: Struts includes built-in support for validating user input, which helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
```

Overall, Struts provides a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It provides a well-defined structure and clear separation of concerns, which makes it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.

## [Struts] What are the core components of the Struts framework?

The core components of the Struts framework are as follows:

```dos
Action: The Action is a Java class that is responsible for processing user requests and returning an appropriate response. It handles user input, interacts with the business logic, and populates data into the View.

ActionForm: The ActionForm is a JavaBean that acts as a container for user input data. It encapsulates the form data and provides getter and setter methods for accessing the data.

ActionMapping: The ActionMapping is a configuration file that maps incoming requests to the appropriate Action classes. It defines the URL pattern, the Action class to invoke, and the View to display the response.

ActionServlet: The ActionServlet is the central controller of the Struts framework. It receives incoming requests, processes them, and delegates the processing to the appropriate Action class.

Struts Configuration File: The Struts configuration file is an XML file that defines the global properties and settings for the application. It contains information about the Action mappings, form beans, and plug-ins.

View: The View is responsible for presenting the processed data to the user. Struts supports different types of Views, such as JSP pages and Velocity templates.

Interceptors: Interceptors are pluggable components that can be used to perform pre and post-processing tasks. They can be used for tasks such as logging, security checks, and error handling.

Tag Library: The Struts Tag Library is a set of custom tags that can be used in JSP pages to simplify the presentation of data. These tags provide a consistent look and feel across the application.
```

Overall, these core components work together to provide a well-defined structure and clear separation of concerns, which makes it easier to build and maintain web applications using the Struts framework.

## [Struts] What is the difference between Struts 1 and Struts 2?

Struts 1 and Struts 2 are both Java-based web application frameworks that follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. However, there are several differences between the two:

```dos
Architecture: Struts 1 follows a traditional MVC architecture, where the Controller is represented by the ActionServlet and the Model and View are represented by ActionForms and JSP pages, respectively. Struts 2, on the other hand, uses a more modern and flexible architecture that allows for more granular control over the MVC components.

Configuration: Struts 1 uses an XML-based configuration file to define the mapping between incoming requests and the appropriate Action classes. Struts 2, on the other hand, uses an annotation-based configuration model that is more flexible and easier to use.

Interceptors: Struts 2 introduces the concept of Interceptors, which are pluggable components that can be used to perform pre and post-processing tasks. This makes it easier to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and validation.

Ajax Support: Struts 2 has built-in support for Ajax, which allows developers to create more responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

Expression Language: Struts 2 supports a powerful Expression Language (EL) that makes it easier to access and manipulate data in the View.

Dependency Injection: Struts 2 provides built-in support for Dependency Injection (DI) through the use of popular DI frameworks such as Spring and Guice.
```

Overall, Struts 2 is a more modern and flexible framework that builds on the strengths of Struts 1 while addressing some of its limitations. It provides a more powerful and extensible architecture, better support for Ajax and dynamic user interfaces, and more convenient configuration and dependency injection options.

## [Struts] How does Struts handle requests and responses?

Struts handles requests and responses through its ActionServlet, which acts as the central controller of the framework. When a user makes a request to a Struts-based web application, the request is first intercepted by the ActionServlet. Here is how Struts handles requests and responses:

```dos
Request Handling: The incoming request is first intercepted by the ActionServlet. The ActionServlet reads the request and extracts the necessary information, such as the URL, parameters, and headers.

Action Mapping: The ActionServlet then consults the Action mapping defined in the Struts configuration file to determine which Action class to invoke. The Action mapping specifies the URL pattern to match and the corresponding Action class to use.

Action Processing: The ActionServlet then creates an instance of the Action class and invokes the appropriate method to process the request. The Action class handles the request by interacting with the Model and populating the necessary data into the View.

View Rendering: The Action class returns an instance of ActionForward, which specifies the View to display the response. The View can be a JSP page, Velocity template, or any other View technology supported by Struts. The View is responsible for rendering the response and presenting the processed data to the user.

Response Handling: Once the View has rendered the response, the ActionServlet sends the response back to the client. Struts automatically sets the necessary HTTP headers, such as content type and content length.

Exception Handling: If an exception occurs during request processing, Struts provides a mechanism for handling the exception and displaying an appropriate error message to the user. This mechanism is implemented through the use of the ActionError and ActionMessage classes.
```

Overall, Struts provides a well-defined structure and clear separation of concerns, which makes it easier to handle requests and responses in a consistent and maintainable manner. The ActionServlet acts as the central controller and delegates the processing to the appropriate Action classes and Views.

## [Struts] What is the role of the Action class in Struts?

The Action class in Struts is an important component of the Struts framework. It plays a central role in processing user requests and generating responses.

When a user sends a request to a Struts-based application, the request is first intercepted by a front controller called the ActionServlet. The ActionServlet is responsible for processing the request and determining which Action class should be used to handle the request.

The Action class is a Java class that contains the business logic for processing the user request. It typically implements the Action interface and overrides its execute() method. In the execute() method, the Action class typically retrieves data from the request, performs any necessary processing or manipulation of the data, and returns a result code that determines which view should be displayed to the user.

The Action class may also interact with other components of the Struts framework, such as form beans, validation rules, and message resources, to provide a consistent and well-structured approach to application development.

Overall, the Action class is a critical component of the Struts framework that enables developers to build robust and maintainable web applications.

## [Struts] What is the Struts configuration file and what is its purpose?

The Struts configuration file is an XML file that contains the configuration settings for a Struts-based web application. Its purpose is to provide a mapping between the request URL and the corresponding action to be taken by the application. The configuration file defines the following components:

```dos
Action Mapping: It maps the request URL to the corresponding action class that should be invoked.

Form Beans: These are the JavaBeans that correspond to the HTML forms used in the application. They define the properties of the form and their corresponding validation rules.

Forward and Include Configurations: They define the navigation rules for the application. They specify the target page or action to be executed after the current request has been processed.

Exception Handling: It defines how the application handles exceptions that occur during the processing of a request.
```

The Struts configuration file is typically named struts-config.xml, and it is located in the WEB-INF directory of the web application. It is read by the Struts framework during the initialization of the application and used to configure the necessary components.

## [Struts] How do you handle form data in Struts?

In Struts, form data can be handled using the ActionForm class. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle form data in Struts:

Define a Java class that extends the ActionForm class. This class will represent the form data submitted by the user. For example:

```java
public class LoginForm extends ActionForm {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }
}
```

In the struts-config.xml file, define the Action that will handle the form submission, and map it to the appropriate JSP page. For example:

```xml
<action name="login" class="com.example.LoginAction">
    <result name="success">/welcome.jsp</result>
    <result name="input">/login.jsp</result>
</action>
```

In the JSP file that displays the form (login.jsp in this case), use the Struts form tag to generate the HTML form. For example:

```jsp
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Login Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Login Form</h2>
    <s:form action="login">
      <s:textfield name="username" label="Username" />
      <s:password name="password" label="Password" />
      <s:submit value="Login" />
    </s:form>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the Action class that handles the form submission, declare a property of the LoginForm class, and implement a method to handle the form submission. For example:

```java
public class LoginAction extends ActionSupport {
    private LoginForm loginForm;

    public LoginForm getLoginForm() {
        return loginForm;
    }

    public void setLoginForm(LoginForm loginForm) {
        this.loginForm = loginForm;
    }

    public String execute() {
        String username = loginForm.getUsername();
        String password = loginForm.getPassword();

        // Validate the username and password
        // ...

        return SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

When the form is submitted, the Struts framework will automatically create an instance of the LoginForm class, populate its properties with the form data, and set it as a property of the LoginAction class. The execute method can then access the form data by calling the getter methods of the LoginForm instance.

Overall, this approach provides a convenient way to handle form data in Struts, and it allows you to easily map form data to Java objects, and validate the input data before processing it.

## [Struts] What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Struts?

Struts is an open-source framework used for building web applications in Java. It provides developers with a set of tools and conventions for building web applications based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using Struts:

Advantages:

```dos
Reusability: Struts provides a set of pre-built components, which can be reused to create new applications quickly. This saves development time and effort.

MVC Architecture: Struts is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the presentation, data, and control logic of an application. This helps developers to build applications that are easy to maintain and modify.

Extensibility: Struts can be easily extended by developers to include custom functionality, such as custom tags, validators, and filters.

Integration with other technologies: Struts integrates easily with other Java technologies, such as JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaBeans, and JavaServer Faces (JSF).

Community Support: Struts has a large and active community of developers, who contribute to the development of the framework and provide support to other developers.
```

Disadvantages:

```dos
Steep learning curve: Struts has a steep learning curve, and developers need to be familiar with Java and MVC architecture to use it effectively.

Complexity: Struts can be complex to set up and configure, which can be a challenge for developers who are new to the framework.

Limited functionality: Struts provides limited functionality compared to other Java web frameworks, such as Spring and Hibernate.

Lack of flexibility: Struts enforces a strict structure and workflow, which may limit the flexibility of developers in building web applications.

Maintenance: Struts has been around for many years, and older versions of the framework may require maintenance and updates to keep up with the latest technologies and security requirements.
```

## [Struts] How do you validate user input in Struts?

Struts provides several ways to validate user input in a web application. One of the most common methods is to use validation rules defined in the Struts configuration file (struts-config.xml), which specify the validation rules for each form bean. Here are the basic steps for validating user input in Struts:

```dos
Define a form bean in the struts-config.xml file: The form bean defines the properties of the form and their corresponding validation rules.

Create an action class that handles the form submission: The action class implements the Action interface and is responsible for processing the user input.

Define the validation rules for the form bean: The validation rules are specified in the struts-config.xml file using the <form-validation> element. You can use predefined validation rules, such as required fields or email format, or you can create custom validation rules.

Associate the validation rules with the form bean: The validation rules are associated with the form bean using the <form-bean> element in the struts-config.xml file.

Implement the validation logic in the action class: The action class should implement the validate() method, which is called by the framework before the execute() method. This method performs additional validation logic not covered by the XML validation rules.

Display validation errors: If there are any validation errors, the framework automatically associates them with the form bean and returns control to the original form with error messages displayed.
```

By following these steps, you can easily validate user input in a Struts-based web application, ensuring that only valid data is processed and stored.

## [Struts] What is the Struts tag library and how do you use it?

The Struts tag library is a set of custom tags that simplify the creation of Struts-based web applications. The tags provide a simple and consistent way to access and manipulate Struts components such as form beans, action mappings, and application resources. Here are the basic steps for using the Struts tag library:

Import the tag library: The Struts tag library is included in the Struts framework and can be imported using the following directive at the beginning of your JSP page:

```jsp
<%@ taglib prefix="s" uri="/struts-tags" %>
```

Use the tags in your JSP page: The Struts tags provide a simple and consistent way to access Struts components in your JSP page. For example, to display the value of a form bean property, you can use the <s:property> tag as follows:

```jsp
<s:property value="myFormBean.myProperty" />
```

This tag will display the value of the myProperty property of the myFormBean form bean.

Pass parameters to the tags: The Struts tags accept parameters that can be used to further customize their behavior. For example, the <s:form> tag accepts a action parameter that specifies the URL to which the form should be submitted:

```jsp
<s:form action="myAction.do">
  ...
</s:form>
```

Use conditional tags: The Struts tag library also includes conditional tags that allow you to conditionally display or hide content based on certain conditions. For example, the <s:if> tag can be used to display content only if a certain condition is true:

```jsp
<s:if test="%{myCondition}">
  ...
</s:if>
```

This tag will display the enclosed content only if the myCondition expression evaluates to true.

By using the Struts tag library, you can simplify the creation of Struts-based web applications and reduce the amount of custom Java code that you need to write. The tags provide a consistent and convenient way to access and manipulate Struts components, making your application more maintainable and easier to understand.

## [Struts] Struts 2 example

Here's an example of a simple Struts 2 application that displays a "Hello, World!" message when a user submits a form:

Create a new Maven project in your IDE, and add the Struts 2 dependency to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.struts</groupId>
    <artifactId>struts2-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.26</version>
</dependency>
```

Create a new Java class named HelloWorldAction that extends ActionSupport. This class will handle the user request and return the response:

```java
package com.example.struts2;

import com.opensymphony.xwork2.ActionSupport;

public class HelloWorldAction extends ActionSupport {

    private String message;

    public String execute() {
        message = "Hello, World!";
        return SUCCESS;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}
```

Create a new JSP file named hello.jsp that displays the message returned by the action:

```jsp
<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" language="java" %>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello, Struts 2!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${message}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Create a new Struts configuration file named struts.xml in the src/main/resources directory. This file defines the mapping between the incoming request and the HelloWorldAction class:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE struts PUBLIC
    "-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 2.5//EN"
    "http://struts.apache.org/dtds/struts-2.5.dtd">

<struts>
    <package name="default" namespace="/" extends="struts-default">
        <action name="hello" class="com.example.struts2.HelloWorldAction">
            <result name="success">/hello.jsp</result>
        </action>
    </package>
</struts>
```

Run the application by deploying it to a web server, and navigate to the following URL in your web browser:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/yourapp/hello.action
```

This should display the "Hello, World!" message in your web browser.

Overall, this example demonstrates how to create a simple Struts 2 application that handles user requests and returns a response using an Action class and a JSP View. The Struts configuration file maps the incoming request to the appropriate Action class and View.

## [Struts] Struts 2 example (2nd)

Sure! Here is a simple Struts 2 example that demonstrates how to create a simple login form and handle its submission using Struts 2 framework:

First, create a JSP file named "login.jsp" in the web application's "WebContent" directory:

```jsp
<%@ taglib prefix="s" uri="/struts-tags" %>

<html>
<head>
<title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Login Page</h2>
<s:form action="login">
<s:textfield name="username" label="Username"/>
<s:password name="password" label="Password"/>
<s:submit value="Login"/>
</s:form>
</body>
</html>
```

This JSP file contains a Struts 2 form that prompts the user for a username and password.

Next, create a Struts 2 action class named "LoginAction" in the "src" directory:

```java
package com.example.actions;

import com.opensymphony.xwork2.ActionSupport;

public class LoginAction extends ActionSupport {

   private String username;
   private String password;

   public String getUsername() {
      return username;
   }

   public void setUsername(String username) {
      this.username = username;
   }

   public String getPassword() {
      return password;
   }

   public void setPassword(String password) {
      this.password = password;
   }

   public String execute() {
      if (username.equals("admin") && password.equals("admin123")) {
         return SUCCESS;
      } else {
         addActionError("Invalid username or password!");
         return ERROR;
      }
   }
}
```

This class extends the ActionSupport class and defines two properties for the username and password fields. The execute() method checks whether the username and password match a hardcoded value and returns either SUCCESS or ERROR depending on the result. If the login fails, an error message is added using the addActionError() method.

Finally, create a Struts 2 configuration file named "struts.xml" in the "WebContent/WEB-INF" directory:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE struts PUBLIC
   "-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 2.3//EN"
   "http://struts.apache.org/dtds/struts-2.3.dtd">
<struts>
   <package name="default" extends="struts-default">
      <action name="login" class="com.example.actions.LoginAction">
         <result name="success">/success.jsp</result>
         <result name="error">/login.jsp</result>
      </action>
   </package>
</struts>
```

This file defines a Struts 2 package that contains an action named "login". The action is mapped to the LoginAction class and specifies two result codes, "success" and "error", which correspond to the two possible outcomes of the login attempt.

When the user submits the login form, the ActionServlet intercepts the request and maps it to the "login" action defined in the configuration file. The LoginAction class is then instantiated and its execute() method is called. If the login is successful, the "success" result is returned and the user is redirected to the "success.jsp" page. If the login fails, the "error" result is returned and the user is redirected back to the "login.jsp" page, where an error message is displayed.

Note that this is just a simple example, and in real-world applications, you would typically use more complex validation logic, database interactions, and other features provided by the Struts 2 framework.

## [Struts] What is SUCCESS in struts 2 app?

In Struts 2, "SUCCESS" is a string constant that represents a successful result. It is commonly used as a return value from the execute() method in an Action class to indicate that the action was successfully executed.

When an action is executed, it may generate a result that needs to be displayed to the user. The result can be a JSP page, a Velocity template, or any other type of content that can be rendered by Struts 2. Each result is associated with a unique string name, which can be used to reference the result in the struts.xml configuration file.

By convention, the string "SUCCESS" is used to represent a successful result. When an action method returns the string "SUCCESS", the Struts 2 framework looks for a result configuration with the name "success" in the struts.xml file, and uses that result to render the response to the user.

For example, consider the following struts.xml configuration:

```xml
<action name="login" class="com.example.LoginAction">
    <result name="success">/welcome.jsp</result>
    <result name="error">/login.jsp</result>
</action>
```

If the execute() method in the LoginAction class returns the string "SUCCESS", Struts 2 will render the /welcome.jsp page. If it returns the string "ERROR", Struts 2 will render the /login.jsp page.

Overall, using "SUCCESS" as the return value for a successful action method is a common convention in Struts 2, but it is not required. You can use any string value to represent a successful result, as long as you configure the corresponding result in the struts.xml file.

## [Struts] struts.xml example

Here's an example struts.xml configuration file for a simple Struts 2 application:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE struts PUBLIC
        "-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Struts Configuration 2.5//EN"
        "http://struts.apache.org/dtds/struts-2.5.dtd">

<struts>

    <constant name="struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation" value="false" />

    <package name="default" namespace="/" extends="struts-default">

        <action name="login" class="com.example.LoginAction">
            <result name="success">/welcome.jsp</result>
            <result name="input">/login.jsp</result>
        </action>

        <action name="logout" class="com.example.LogoutAction">
            <result name="success">/index.jsp</result>
        </action>

    </package>

</struts>
```

Let's go over each part of this configuration file:

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration specifies the DTD (Document Type Definition) for the struts.xml file. In this case, it refers to the DTD for Struts 2.5.

The <struts> element is the root element of the configuration file.

The <constant> element specifies a constant that will be used by the Struts 2 framework. In this case, it disables the Dynamic Method Invocation feature, which is not recommended for production use.

The <package> element defines a package for the application. The name attribute specifies the name of the package, and the namespace attribute specifies the URL namespace for the package. The extends attribute specifies that this package extends the struts-default package, which provides default configuration settings.

The <action> element defines an action for the package. The name attribute specifies the name of the action, and the class attribute specifies the Java class that implements the action. The result elements define the results that can be returned by the action, and specify the JSP pages that should be rendered for each result.

In this example, the login action maps to the com.example.LoginAction Java class, and has two possible results: "success" and "input". If the action is successful, the /welcome.jsp page will be rendered. If there are validation errors, the /login.jsp page will be rendered.

The logout action maps to the com.example.LogoutAction Java class, and has one possible result: "success". If the action is successful, the /index.jsp page will be rendered.

Note that this is just a simple example, and there are many more configuration options available in Struts 2. The struts.xml file is the main configuration file for a Struts 2 application, and it defines how the framework should handle requests, map actions to Java classes, and render responses to the user.
