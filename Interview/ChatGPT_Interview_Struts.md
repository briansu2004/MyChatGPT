These questions are intended to assess your knowledge and understanding of the Struts framework and its core concepts. To prepare for a Struts interview, you should review the Struts documentation and sample code, and be able to provide specific examples of how you have used Struts in your previous work experience.

## [Struts] What is Struts and how does it work?

Struts is a popular open-source web application framework for developing Java-based enterprise applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and is designed to simplify the development of web applications by providing a set of tools and APIs.

Here is how Struts works:

```dos
Request Handling: When a user requests a web page, the request is first intercepted by the Struts framework. Struts then forwards the request to the appropriate Action class.

Action Class: The Action class receives the request and processes it by interacting with the Model (business logic) and populating the necessary data into the View (presentation layer).

View: The View is responsible for presenting the processed data to the user. Struts uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Velocity templates to generate the HTML output.

Struts Tag Library: Struts comes with a set of custom tags that can be used in JSP pages to simplify the presentation of data. These tags provide a consistent look and feel across the application.

Struts Configuration: Struts uses a configuration file to map incoming requests to the appropriate Action classes. This file also defines the global properties and settings for the application.

Interceptors: Struts provides a mechanism called Interceptors to intercept the request and response objects. This allows you to perform pre and post-processing tasks such as logging, security checks, and error handling.

Validation: Struts includes built-in support for validating user input, which helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
```

Overall, Struts provides a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. It provides a well-defined structure and clear separation of concerns, which makes it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.

## [Struts] What are the core components of the Struts framework?

The core components of the Struts framework are as follows:

```dos
Action: The Action is a Java class that is responsible for processing user requests and returning an appropriate response. It handles user input, interacts with the business logic, and populates data into the View.

ActionForm: The ActionForm is a JavaBean that acts as a container for user input data. It encapsulates the form data and provides getter and setter methods for accessing the data.

ActionMapping: The ActionMapping is a configuration file that maps incoming requests to the appropriate Action classes. It defines the URL pattern, the Action class to invoke, and the View to display the response.

ActionServlet: The ActionServlet is the central controller of the Struts framework. It receives incoming requests, processes them, and delegates the processing to the appropriate Action class.

Struts Configuration File: The Struts configuration file is an XML file that defines the global properties and settings for the application. It contains information about the Action mappings, form beans, and plug-ins.

View: The View is responsible for presenting the processed data to the user. Struts supports different types of Views, such as JSP pages and Velocity templates.

Interceptors: Interceptors are pluggable components that can be used to perform pre and post-processing tasks. They can be used for tasks such as logging, security checks, and error handling.

Tag Library: The Struts Tag Library is a set of custom tags that can be used in JSP pages to simplify the presentation of data. These tags provide a consistent look and feel across the application.
```

Overall, these core components work together to provide a well-defined structure and clear separation of concerns, which makes it easier to build and maintain web applications using the Struts framework.

## [Struts] What is the difference between Struts 1 and Struts 2?

Struts 1 and Struts 2 are both Java-based web application frameworks that follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. However, there are several differences between the two:

```dos
Architecture: Struts 1 follows a traditional MVC architecture, where the Controller is represented by the ActionServlet and the Model and View are represented by ActionForms and JSP pages, respectively. Struts 2, on the other hand, uses a more modern and flexible architecture that allows for more granular control over the MVC components.

Configuration: Struts 1 uses an XML-based configuration file to define the mapping between incoming requests and the appropriate Action classes. Struts 2, on the other hand, uses an annotation-based configuration model that is more flexible and easier to use.

Interceptors: Struts 2 introduces the concept of Interceptors, which are pluggable components that can be used to perform pre and post-processing tasks. This makes it easier to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and validation.

Ajax Support: Struts 2 has built-in support for Ajax, which allows developers to create more responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

Expression Language: Struts 2 supports a powerful Expression Language (EL) that makes it easier to access and manipulate data in the View.

Dependency Injection: Struts 2 provides built-in support for Dependency Injection (DI) through the use of popular DI frameworks such as Spring and Guice.
```

Overall, Struts 2 is a more modern and flexible framework that builds on the strengths of Struts 1 while addressing some of its limitations. It provides a more powerful and extensible architecture, better support for Ajax and dynamic user interfaces, and more convenient configuration and dependency injection options.
