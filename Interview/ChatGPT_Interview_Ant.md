What is the difference between a build.xml file and a pom.xml file?
A build.xml file is used by ANT to build and package Java applications, while a pom.xml file is used by Maven for the same purpose. While both files serve similar purposes, they have different syntax and configuration options.

What is the difference between the Ant and Maven?
Ant and Maven are both build automation tools for Java applications, but they have different approaches and philosophies. Ant is a more flexible and customizable tool that requires more configuration, while Maven provides a standard project structure and conventions that make it easier to manage dependencies and build applications.

What is the difference between the Ant and Gradle?
Ant and Gradle are both build automation tools for Java applications, but they have different approaches and philosophies. Ant is a more flexible and customizable tool that requires more configuration, while Gradle provides a domain-specific language that simplifies build scripts and allows for more complex build configurations.

How do you run tests in ANT?
To run tests in ANT, you can use the "junit" task to run JUnit tests or the "testng" task to run TestNG tests. You can also specify a specific test or test suite to run with the "includes" attribute.
