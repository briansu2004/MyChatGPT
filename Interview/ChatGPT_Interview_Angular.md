```dos
Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) and provides a comprehensive set of features for creating complex web applications.

AngularJS, on the other hand, is the predecessor of Angular and is an older version of the framework. AngularJS is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and uses JavaScript to build web applications, whereas Angular uses TypeScript.

The different components in Angular and their purpose are:

Component - It is the building block of Angular applications and defines a specific part of the user interface (UI).

Directive - It is used to add behavior to an existing DOM element or to create a new custom element.

Service - It is a singleton object that provides functionality to different parts of the application.

Pipe - It is used for formatting and transforming data in the UI.

Data binding in Angular refers to the automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view. There are four types of data binding in Angular:

Interpolation - It is used to display data in the view.

Property binding - It is used to set the value of an element property.

Event binding - It is used to respond to user events such as clicks and keystrokes.

Two-way binding - It is used to synchronize data between the model and the view.

A directive in Angular is a behavior that can be attached to an existing DOM element or used to create a new custom element. A component is a directive with a template.

A service in Angular is a singleton object that provides functionality to different parts of the application. Services can be injected into components and other services.

Dependency injection in Angular is a design pattern that allows objects to be loosely coupled and easily testable. It is used to provide dependencies to components and services.

Routing in Angular is a feature that allows navigation between different views in an application. It is implemented using the RouterModule.

To optimize Angular application performance, some of the best practices are:

Using lazy loading to load modules on demand.

Minimizing the number of HTTP requests.

Using AOT compilation.

Reducing the size of the application by using tree shaking and code splitting.

AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation in Angular is a process of compiling the application code at build time. JIT (Just in Time) compilation, on the other hand, compiles the application code at runtime. AOT compilation results in faster startup time and better performance.

The different lifecycle hooks in Angular are:

ngOnChanges - It is called when a data-bound property value changes.

ngOnInit - It is called when the component is initialized.

ngDoCheck - It is called during every change detection cycle.

ngOnDestroy - It is called when the component is about to be destroyed.

Form validation in Angular can be implemented using built-in validators or custom validators. Built-in validators include required, minlength, maxlength, and pattern. Custom validators can be created using the Validators class.

Pipes in Angular are used for formatting and transforming data in the UI. Pipes can be used to filter, sort, and transform data.

Error handling in Angular can be done using try-catch blocks, error handlers, and interceptors. Interceptors are used to intercept HTTP requests and responses and handle errors.

zone.js in Angular is a library that helps in managing asynchronous operations in Angular applications. It provides a way to track and manage the execution context of an application.

ngZone in Angular is a service that provides a way to execute code outside the Angular zone. This is useful for improving application performance and avoiding unnecessary change detection cycles.
```

## [Angular] 5 Angular interview questions

Questions

```dos
What is change detection in Angular and how does it work?
What is server-side rendering in Angular and how is it useful?
What are Angular elements and how are they used?
How do you implement lazy loading in Angular?
```

Answers

```dos
Change detection in Angular is the process of detecting changes in the application's data model and updating the view accordingly. Angular uses a mechanism called Zone.js to track changes in the application's data model and update the view. When a change occurs, Angular runs a change detection cycle to update the view. Change detection in Angular is a critical part of the framework and can impact the application's performance.

Server-side rendering (SSR) in Angular is the process of rendering the initial view of a web application on the server and sending it to the client's browser. This can improve the initial loading time of the application and improve search engine optimization (SEO) by providing a fully rendered HTML page to the search engine crawlers. Angular supports SSR using the Angular Universal library.

Angular Elements are a feature introduced in Angular 6 that allows developers to package Angular components as custom elements that can be used in non-Angular applications. Angular Elements allow developers to create reusable UI components that can be shared across multiple projects and platforms. Angular Elements are created using the @angular/elements package and can be used in any JavaScript application.

Lazy loading in Angular is a technique that allows developers to load specific parts of the application on demand, instead of loading the entire application at once. This can improve the initial loading time of the application and reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded. In Angular, lazy loading is implemented using the loadChildren method in the router configuration.
```

## [Angular] What are ng-content and ng-container in Angular and how are they used?

In Angular, ng-content and ng-container are directives that allow you to dynamically insert content into your templates.

ng-content is a directive that acts as a placeholder in a component's template. It is used to project the content that is defined outside of the component into the component's template. When ng-content is used in a component's template, the content that is defined between the component's opening and closing tags is inserted into the template at the location where ng-content is defined.

For example, suppose you have a component called app-card that represents a card UI element. You can use ng-content to allow users of the component to define the content of the card by passing it in from the parent component's template:

```html
<app-card>
  <h2>Card Title</h2>
  <p>Card Description</p>
</app-card>
```

In this example, the content between the app-card tags is passed into the app-card component's template using ng-content.

ng-container is another directive that is used to group content together in a template without creating any additional HTML elements. It is often used to group together multiple ng-content directives or to conditionally render content.

For example, suppose you have a component called app-layout that represents the layout of a page. You can use ng-container to group together the header, content, and footer of the page:

```html
<app-layout>
  <ng-container header>
    <app-header></app-header>
  </ng-container>
  <ng-container content>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  </ng-container>
  <ng-container footer>
    <app-footer></app-footer>
  </ng-container>
</app-layout>
```

In this example, ng-container is used to group together the header, content, and footer of the app-layout component. The header, content, and footer attributes are used to differentiate between the different groups of content.

## [Angular] What common ng commands do we use in an Angular project?

Here are some of the most common ng commands used in an Angular project:

```dos
ng new [project-name] - creates a new Angular project with the given name.
ng serve - compiles and serves the application in development mode, allowing you to view it in your browser at http://localhost:4200/.
ng build - compiles the application into an output directory that can be deployed to a server.
ng generate component [component-name] - generates a new component with the given name.
ng generate service [service-name] - generates a new service with the given name.
ng test - runs unit tests for the application.
ng lint - runs linting checks on the application's code.
ng update - updates the Angular dependencies in the project to the latest versions.
ng add [package-name] - adds a new package to the project, such as a third-party library or tool.
```

These are some of the most commonly used ng commands, but there are many others available as well. You can get a full list of available commands by running ng help or ng --help.

## [Angular] Angular lifecycle

Angular has a number of lifecycle hooks that allow you to tap into various stages of a component or directive's lifecycle, and execute custom logic at those stages. Here are the most commonly used Angular lifecycle hooks in the order they are called:

```dos
ngOnChanges: This hook is called when the input properties of a component change. It receives a SimpleChanges object that contains information about each changed property.

ngOnInit: This hook is called once, after the first ngOnChanges call, when the component is initialized. It is a good place to perform initialization logic.

ngDoCheck: This hook is called every time Angular checks for changes. It is a good place to perform custom change detection logic.

ngAfterContentInit: This hook is called after Angular projects external content into a component's view. It is a good place to perform initialization logic that relies on external content.

ngAfterContentChecked: This hook is called every time Angular checks for changes in the content projected into a component. It is a good place to perform custom change detection logic on that content.

ngAfterViewInit: This hook is called after Angular initializes a component's view and child views. It is a good place to perform initialization logic that relies on the component's view and child views.

ngAfterViewChecked: This hook is called every time Angular checks for changes in a component's view and child views. It is a good place to perform custom change detection logic on that view.

ngOnDestroy: This hook is called just before a component is destroyed. It is a good place to perform any cleanup logic, such as unsubscribing from observables or clearing timers.
```

By using these lifecycle hooks, you can execute custom logic at various stages of a component's or directive's lifecycle, which can be useful for a wide range of use cases, such as managing state, handling events, and performing initialization and cleanup tasks.

## [Angular] Angular @Input

In Angular, @Input() is a decorator that is used to define an input property for a component. An input property is a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

To use @Input(), you need to import it from the @angular/core module and add it before the input property you want to define. For example:

```angular
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>{{ inputData }}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() inputData: string;
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a child component called ChildComponent with an input property called inputData. The @Input() decorator is used to mark inputData as an input property.

To use this input property in the parent component, you need to bind it to a property in the parent component. For example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    <app-child [inputData]="parentData"></app-child>
  `
})
export class ParentComponent {
  parentData = 'This is the data passed from the parent component.';
}
```

In the above example, we have a parent component called ParentComponent that passes a value to the inputData input property of the ChildComponent using property binding. The value of parentData in the parent component is passed to the inputData input property in the child component.

## [Angular] Angular ng-style

In Angular, ngStyle is a directive that allows you to dynamically set CSS styles on an element based on the state of your component. With ngStyle, you can apply styles based on certain conditions, making your UI more dynamic.

To use ngStyle, you need to bind it to a property in your component that returns an object of CSS styles. For example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div [ngStyle]="{ 'color': textColor, 'background-color': bgColor }">
      This text has dynamically set styles!
    </div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  textColor = 'red';
  bgColor = 'yellow';
}
```

In the above example, we have a component called MyComponent that uses ngStyle to set the color and background-color styles of a div element. The styles are defined in an object that is bound to the ngStyle directive. The textColor and bgColor properties in the component define the values for the styles.

You can also use ngStyle to conditionally apply styles based on the state of your component. For example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div [ngStyle]="{ 'color': isActive ? 'green' : 'red', 'text-decoration': isActive ? 'underline' : 'none' }">
      This text has dynamically set styles!
    </div>
    <button (click)="toggleActive()">Toggle Active</button>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  isActive = false;

  toggleActive() {
    this.isActive = !this.isActive;
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have a component called MyComponent that uses ngStyle to conditionally apply styles to a div element based on the value of the isActive property. When isActive is true, the text color is green and the text has an underline. When isActive is false, the text color is red and the text has no underline. The toggleActive method is called when a button is clicked and toggles the value of isActive.

## [Angular] Why we need a constructor in Angular?

In Angular, a constructor is used to create an instance of a component, directive, or service. It is a special method that gets called when an object of a class is created.

Here are some reasons why we need a constructor in Angular:

```dos
Dependency injection: The constructor is used to inject dependencies into a component or service. Angular provides a dependency injection system that allows us to declare the dependencies of a component or service in the constructor, and then Angular injects them automatically when an instance is created. This helps to decouple the code and make it more modular and testable.

Initializing properties: The constructor is used to initialize the properties of a component or service. It is often used to set default values or to initialize variables that are needed throughout the component or service.

Lifecycle hooks: The constructor is used to register lifecycle hooks for a component or directive. Lifecycle hooks are methods that get called at specific points during the lifecycle of a component or directive, such as when it is created, destroyed, or updated.

Inheritance: The constructor is used to call the constructor of the base class when a derived class is created. This is necessary to inherit properties and methods from the base class.
```

In summary, the constructor is an important part of Angular because it is used to create an instance of a component or service, inject dependencies, initialize properties, register lifecycle hooks, and call the constructor of the base class.

## [Angular] Angular Dependency injection example

Sure, here's an example of how to use dependency injection in Angular:

Let's say we have a UserService class that we want to use in a UserComponent:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class UserService {
  getUsers() {
    // implementation
  }
}
```

In the UserService class, we define a method called getUsers that returns a list of users.

Next, we create a UserComponent that uses the UserService to get a list of users:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  template: `
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let user of users">{{ user }}</li>
    </ul>
  `
})
export class UserComponent {
  users: string[];

  constructor(private userService: UserService) {
    this.users = this.userService.getUsers();
  }
}
```

In the UserComponent class, we use the constructor method to inject the UserService using the private keyword. We then call the getUsers method of the UserService to get a list of users and assign it to the users property of the component. Finally, we use the *ngFor directive to display the list of users in the template.

Note that we are using the providedIn: 'root' option in the @Injectable decorator of the UserService class to provide the service at the root level. This means that the same instance of the service will be shared across the entire application. If you want to provide the service at a component level, you can use the providers array in the @Component decorator instead.

In summary, dependency injection in Angular is used to inject dependencies into a component or service. This makes the code more modular, decoupled, and testable.

## [Angular] Angular @Component

In Angular, @Component is a decorator that is used to define a component. It is a function that is applied to the component class and provides metadata about the component to Angular.

The @Component decorator takes an object as its argument, which can contain properties such as:

```dos
selector: A CSS selector that defines the component's tag name in HTML. This allows the component to be used in templates by its tag name.
template or templateUrl: The HTML template of the component. It defines the structure of the component and the data bindings used to display and manipulate data.
style or styleUrls: The CSS styles that are applied to the component.
inputs: An array of property names that the component accepts as inputs from its parent component.
outputs: An array of event names that the component emits to its parent component.
providers: An array of services that are available to the component and its children.
```

Here's an example of a component defined using the @Component decorator:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>Example component</p>
  `,
  styles: [`
    h1 {
      color: blue;
    }
  `]
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Example';
}
```

In this example, the @Component decorator is used to define an ExampleComponent. The selector property sets the component's tag name to app-example, and the template property defines the HTML template of the component. The styles property sets the CSS styles for the component. The component class ExampleComponent defines the title property, which is used in the template to display the component's title.

## [Angular] Angular APP_INITIALIZER

In Angular, APP_INITIALIZER is a special token that represents a function that is executed when the application is initialized. It is used to perform some initialization tasks before the application starts.

The APP_INITIALIZER token is used in the providers array of the app module (app.module.ts). The function that is associated with this token is executed during the app initialization process, before any other providers are initialized. The function can be synchronous or asynchronous, and it can return a promise or an observable.

Here's an example of how to use APP_INITIALIZER to perform some initialization tasks:

```typescript
import { APP_INITIALIZER, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

// Initialize the app configuration before the app starts
export function initializeApp(configService: ConfigService) {
  return () => configService.loadConfig();
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
  providers: [
    ConfigService,
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: initializeApp,
      deps: [ConfigService],
      multi: true
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

In this example, we define a ConfigService that is responsible for loading the configuration for the application. We then define a function called initializeApp that takes an instance of the ConfigService and returns a function that loads the configuration. We pass this function to the APP_INITIALIZER provider, along with the ConfigService dependency.

During the application initialization process, Angular will execute the initializeApp function before any other providers are initialized. The initializeApp function will load the configuration using the ConfigService, which can be an asynchronous operation that returns a promise or an observable.

Using APP_INITIALIZER ensures that the configuration is loaded before the application starts and makes it available to other components and services in the application.

## [Angular] Angular providers

In Angular, providers is an array of providers that define the dependencies for a component or a module. Providers are used to create and manage instances of services, which are used to share data and functionality across different parts of the application.

A provider can be defined at the component level or at the module level. When a provider is defined at the component level, it is available only to that component and its children. When a provider is defined at the module level, it is available to all components and services that are part of that module.

Providers can be defined in two ways:

Using a class: A provider can be defined as a class that implements an injectable service. The class can have a constructor that specifies the dependencies that the service requires.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class UserService {
  getUsers() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a UserService as an injectable service using the @Injectable decorator. We also specify that this service is provided at the root level using the providedIn property. This means that this service is a singleton that is available to the entire application.

Using a value: A provider can be defined as a simple value or object. This is useful when we want to provide a configuration or a constant value to the application.

```typescript
import { APP_BASE_HREF } from '@angular/common';

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    { provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: '/my-app' }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

In this example, we define a provider for the APP_BASE_HREF token using an object that specifies the useValue property. This value is used by the RouterModule to generate the URLs for the application.

Angular also provides other types of providers such as FactoryProvider, ClassProvider, ExistingProvider, and UseClassProvider, which are used for more complex scenarios.

Providers are an essential part of dependency injection in Angular, which is used to manage the dependencies between components and services. Providers enable us to create and share instances of services across the application in a modular and scalable way.

## [Angular] Angular APP_BASE_HREF

In Angular, APP_BASE_HREF is a provider token that represents the base URL for the application. The APP_BASE_HREF token is used by the RouterModule to generate the URLs for the application.

The APP_BASE_HREF provider can be defined in the providers array of the app module (app.module.ts). By default, the value of APP_BASE_HREF is /, which means that the application is hosted at the root of the domain.

Here's an example of how to define APP_BASE_HREF in the AppModule:

```typescript
import { APP_BASE_HREF } from '@angular/common';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  providers: [
    { provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: '/my-app' }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

In this example, we define a provider for APP_BASE_HREF with the value of '/my-app'. This means that the application is hosted at the /my-app URL instead of the root of the domain.

The APP_BASE_HREF provider is used by the RouterModule to generate URLs for the application. For example, if we define a route with the path '/dashboard', the URL for that route would be '/my-app/dashboard' if the APP_BASE_HREF is set to '/my-app'.

It's important to set the correct value of APP_BASE_HREF when the application is hosted in a subdirectory or when it's served from a different URL than the root of the domain. Setting the wrong value of APP_BASE_HREF can result in broken links and other issues.

## [Angular] Angular decorator

In Angular, a decorator is a special type of function that can be attached to a class, property, or method. Decorators are used to modify or extend the behavior of the decorated item at runtime. Angular uses decorators extensively to provide features such as dependency injection, component metadata, and routing.

Decorators are defined using the @ symbol followed by the decorator name. Here's an example of a decorator that logs a message when a method is called:

```typescript
function log(target: any, name: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const original = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function(...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${name} with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
    const result = original.apply(this, args);
    console.log(`Result of ${name}: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
    return result;
  };
  return descriptor;
}
```

In this example, we define a decorator function called log that takes three arguments: the target object (i.e., the class), the name of the decorated method, and the property descriptor. The decorator replaces the original method with a new method that logs the arguments and return value of the original method.

To apply the log decorator to a method, we can use the decorator syntax:

```typescript
class MyService {
  @log
  getData() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, we apply the log decorator to the getData method of the MyService class. When the getData method is called, the decorator logs the arguments and return value of the method.

Angular provides several built-in decorators, including:

```dos
@Component: Defines the metadata for a component
@Injectable: Marks a class as an injectable service
@NgModule: Defines the metadata for a module
@Input: Marks a property as an input binding for a component
@Output: Marks a property as an output binding for a component
```

These decorators are used to provide the core features of Angular, including dependency injection, component composition, and data binding.

## [Angular] Angular NgModule

In Angular, a module is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to a specific purpose, such as organizing components, directives, pipes, and services into a functional unit. Modules help to keep the code organized, reusable, and easy to maintain.

An Angular module is defined using the @NgModule decorator, which takes a metadata object that describes the module's properties, such as imports, declarations, providers, and exports.

Here's an example of a simple Angular module:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { MyComponent } from './my.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [MyComponent]
})
export class MyModule { }
```

In this example, we define a module called MyModule that declares a component called MyComponent. The module also imports the CommonModule from Angular, which provides common directives and pipes, and exports the MyComponent so that it can be used in other modules.

The @NgModule decorator can take several properties, including:

```dos
declarations: A list of the components, directives, and pipes that belong to the module.
imports: A list of the other modules that this module depends on.
exports: A list of the components, directives, and pipes that can be used by other modules.
providers: A list of the services that the module provides to the components and directives within the module.
bootstrap: A list of the components that should be bootstrapped when the application starts.
```

Angular provides several built-in modules, including:

```dos
BrowserModule: Provides the browser-specific implementation of the core directives and services.
FormsModule: Provides the ngModel directive and other forms-related directives and services.
HttpClientModule: Provides the HttpClient service for making HTTP requests.
RouterModule: Provides the routing functionality for the application.
```

By creating and using modules in an Angular application, developers can create a scalable and maintainable architecture for their application.

## [Angular] What does bootstrap mean in Angular?

In Angular, "bootstrap" refers to the process of starting up the application by loading the root module and its components into the browser. When an Angular application is bootstrapped, Angular creates the component hierarchy and renders the application on the page.

The @NgModule decorator has a bootstrap property that allows you to specify which component(s) should be bootstrapped when the application starts up. By default, the AppComponent is bootstrapped.

Here's an example of how to bootstrap an Angular application:

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

In this example, we import the platformBrowserDynamic function from the @angular/platform-browser-dynamic module and use it to bootstrap the AppModule.

When the application is bootstrapped, Angular creates the root component (in this case, AppComponent) and inserts it into the DOM. Angular then recursively creates and inserts any child components defined in the component's template.

The bootstrap process is important because it allows Angular to start the change detection process and keep the application state in sync with the user interface. Any changes made to the application state are automatically propagated to the UI, and any user events are automatically handled by the application code.

## [Angular] What is @angular/platform-browser-dynamic

@angular/platform-browser-dynamic is a module in Angular that provides a platform for dynamically compiling and bootstrapping an Angular application in a browser environment. It is used to build applications that are compiled and executed in the client-side browser, rather than on the server.

This module provides the platformBrowserDynamic() function, which returns a PlatformRef instance that can be used to bootstrap an Angular module at runtime. The PlatformRef is responsible for creating and managing the application's component tree, providing services and dependencies to the components, and handling change detection and rendering.

Here's an example of how to use @angular/platform-browser-dynamic to bootstrap an Angular application:

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

In this example, we import the platformBrowserDynamic function from the @angular/platform-browser-dynamic module and use it to bootstrap the AppModule. The bootstrapModule method returns a Promise that resolves to the NgModuleRef for the bootstrapped module.

By using @angular/platform-browser-dynamic, developers can create dynamic, client-side applications that can be executed in the browser environment. This module is a key part of the Angular platform and is used extensively in Angular applications.

## [Angular] Angular promise

In Angular, a Promise is a built-in JavaScript object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future. Promises are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle operations that may take some time to complete, such as making HTTP requests or reading from a file.

Angular uses Promise objects extensively in its APIs to handle asynchronous operations, such as the HttpClient service for making HTTP requests or the resolve method of the ActivatedRoute in the routing module.

Here's an example of how to use a Promise in Angular to make an HTTP request:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

export class MyService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  getData(): Promise<any> {
    return this.http.get('/api/data').toPromise();
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a service called MyService that uses the HttpClient service to make an HTTP GET request to the /api/data endpoint. The get method returns a Observable object, but we can use the toPromise method to convert it to a Promise.

The getData method returns the Promise object, which can be used to handle the asynchronous response from the server. We can use the then method to handle the successful response and the catch method to handle any errors.

```typescript
myService.getData()
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In this example, we call the getData method on the myService instance and use the then and catch methods to handle the successful and error responses, respectively.

By using Promise objects in Angular, developers can write clean and concise code that handles asynchronous operations in a simple and intuitive way.

## [Angular] Angular component vs module

In Angular, a component is a building block of the user interface that defines a part of the application's functionality and UI behavior. It consists of a TypeScript class that contains the logic for the component's behavior and an HTML template that defines the component's view.

On the other hand, a module is a logical collection of related components, directives, pipes, and services that are used to organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. A module can contain one or more components and other types of Angular artifacts.

The main differences between components and modules are as follows:

Scope: Components define the behavior and UI of a single part of an application, while modules provide a way to organize related components, services, and other artifacts into a cohesive unit.

Purpose: Components are used to build the UI and define the behavior of a specific part of the application, while modules are used to organize the application into functional units that can be easily maintained and reused.

Import/export: Components are typically defined within a module and can be exported to be used in other modules, while modules can be imported into other modules to provide access to their components, services, and other artifacts.

In summary, components and modules are both important building blocks of Angular applications, but they serve different purposes. Components define the UI and behavior of a specific part of the application, while modules provide a way to organize related components and other artifacts into a cohesive unit that can be easily maintained and reused across the application.

## [Angular] Angular pipe

In Angular, a pipe is a feature that allows you to transform data in your templates before it is rendered to the user. Pipes can be used to format dates, numbers, strings, and other types of data in a variety of ways.

Pipes are defined using the @Pipe decorator and can be used in template expressions using the pipe operator (|). The basic syntax for using a pipe in a template expression is as follows:

```html
{{ value | pipeName:param1:param2... }}
```

Here, value is the data to be transformed, pipeName is the name of the pipe, and param1, param2, etc. are any additional parameters that the pipe may require.

Angular comes with several built-in pipes, including:

date: Formats a date according to a specified format.
decimal: Formats a number as a decimal according to a specified precision.
currency: Formats a number as a currency value according to a specified currency code and format.
percent: Formats a number as a percentage value.
You can also create your own custom pipes by defining a TypeScript class that implements the PipeTransform interface and has a transform() method that takes the input value and any optional parameters and returns the transformed output. For example, here's a simple custom pipe that formats a string as all uppercase:

```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'uppercase'
})
export class UppercasePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

To use this pipe in a template expression, you would write:

```html
{{ 'hello world' | uppercase }}
```

This would output "HELLO WORLD".

In summary, pipes are a powerful feature of Angular that allow you to transform data in your templates before it is rendered to the user. You can use built-in pipes or create your own custom pipes to format dates, numbers, strings, and other types of data in a variety of ways.

## [Angular] Angular router

In Angular, the router is a built-in service that enables navigation between different views in an application. It allows users to navigate to different routes, which are represented by URLs, and load the appropriate components for each route.

The router works by defining a set of routes in the application's routing module, which maps URL patterns to component classes. When a user navigates to a specific URL, the router matches the URL to a route and loads the corresponding component, rendering it in the application's main view.

Here's an example of how to use the router in an Angular application:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about.component';
import { ContactComponent } from './contact.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: 'contact', component: ContactComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

In this example, we define a set of routes in the AppRoutingModule module that maps the empty URL to the HomeComponent, the /about URL to the AboutComponent, and the /contact URL to the ContactComponent.

The RouterModule.forRoot(routes) method configures the router with the set of routes defined in the routes array, and the AppRoutingModule module exports the RouterModule so that it can be used in other parts of the application.

To use the router in a component, we can use the routerLink directive to navigate to a specific route:

```html
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/">Home</a>
  <a routerLink="/about">About</a>
  <a routerLink="/contact">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

In this example, we define a navigation bar that uses the routerLink directive to navigate to the HomeComponent, AboutComponent, and ContactComponent routes, respectively.

The router is a powerful and flexible tool that enables developers to create complex, multi-page applications with ease. It provides a simple and intuitive way to manage application state and navigation, making it a key part of the Angular platform.

## [Angular] What are the typical steps for a new angular app?

Here are the typical steps to create a new Angular application:

```dos
Install Angular CLI: Install the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) globally using the following command: npm install -g @angular/cli.

Create a new Angular project: Once Angular CLI is installed, create a new Angular project by running the following command: ng new my-app. This will create a new Angular project with the name "my-app" in the current directory.

Run the Angular application: Navigate to the newly created project directory by running cd my-app, and start the application by running the command: ng serve. This will compile the application and open it in a web browser at <http://localhost:4200>.

Create Angular components: Angular components are the building blocks of an Angular application. To create a new component, use the following command: ng generate component component-name. This will generate a new component with the name "component-name".

Add Angular routing: Angular routing enables navigation between different views of an application. To add routing, run the command ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app. This will generate a new routing module that you can modify to define your application's routes.

Build and deploy the Angular application: Once the application is ready for production, you can build it by running the command ng build --prod. This will create a production-ready version of the application that you can deploy to a web server.
```

These are the typical steps for creating a new Angular application. However, depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to modify or add additional steps.

## [Angular] How to do angular tests

Angular comes with a built-in testing framework that allows you to write unit tests for your application. Here are the steps to create and run tests in Angular:

Create a new test file: Angular tests are typically stored in a separate folder named src/app. To create a new test file, create a new .spec.ts file with the same name as the component or service you want to test. For example, if you want to test the AppComponent, create a new file named app.component.spec.ts.

Write the test: Inside the test file, write the test cases using Jasmine testing framework. Jasmine is included with Angular by default. For example, to test the AppComponent, you can write a test case that checks if the title property is set correctly:

```typescript
import { TestBed, async } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

describe('AppComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent],
    }).compileComponents();
  }));

  it('should create the app', () => {
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    const app = fixture.componentInstance;
    expect(app).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it(`should have as title 'my-app'`, () => {
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
    const app = fixture.componentInstance;
    expect(app.title).toEqual('my-app');
  });
});
```

Run the test: To run the test, use the Angular CLI command ng test. This will run all the tests in your application and display the results in the console.
By default, Angular CLI generates a test file for each component, directive, and service that you create. You can also create tests for pipes, validators, and other Angular features. Writing tests is an essential part of building a robust and reliable Angular application, so it's important to invest time in learning and implementing testing practices.

## [Angular] How to do Angular end to end test?

End-to-end (E2E) testing is used to simulate real user interactions with your Angular application. Angular comes with a built-in end-to-end testing framework called Protractor. Here are the steps to create and run end-to-end tests in Angular:

Install Protractor: Protractor is a Node.js package that you can install using the following command: npm install -g protractor. This will install Protractor globally on your system.

Start the Selenium server: Protractor uses the Selenium web driver to control the browser during testing. You can start the Selenium server by running the command: webdriver-manager start. This will start the Selenium server in the background.

Create a new test file: End-to-end tests are typically stored in a separate folder named e2e. To create a new test file, run the command: ng e2e --init. This will create a new folder e2e and generate a sample test file app.e2e-spec.ts.

Write the end-to-end test: Inside the test file, write the test cases using Protractor's API. For example, to test the login page of your application, you can write a test case that logs in a user with valid credentials:

```typescript
import { browser, by, element } from 'protractor';

describe('Login', () => {
  it('should login with valid credentials', () => {
    browser.get('/login');
    element(by.css('#username')).sendKeys('user');
    element(by.css('#password')).sendKeys('pass');
    element(by.css('#login-button')).click();
    expect(browser.getCurrentUrl()).toContain('/dashboard');
  });
});
```

Run the end-to-end test: To run the test, use the command: ng e2e. This will start the application and run the end-to-end test in a real browser. The test results will be displayed in the console.
By default, Angular CLI generates a sample end-to-end test file that you can modify to suit your application's needs. Writing end-to-end tests is an important part of building a robust and reliable Angular application, so it's important to invest time in learning and implementing end-to-end testing practices.

## [Angular] My Angular app has many console.log statements. How do I remove or disable them when I deploy to production?

You should remove all console.log statements from your code before deploying to production. This is because console.log statements can impact the performance of your application and expose sensitive information to end-users.

To remove console.log statements from your code, you can use a build tool like webpack or rollup that supports tree shaking. Tree shaking is a technique that removes unused code from your application during the build process. This means that any console.log statements that are not used in your application will be automatically removed from the final build.

You can also use a plugin like babel-plugin-transform-remove-console to remove all console.log statements from your code. This plugin removes all console.log statements from your code during the build process, so they will not appear in the final build.

Here's how you can configure the plugin in your Angular project:

Install the plugin: npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-remove-console

Add the plugin to your .babelrc file:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-remove-console"]
}
```

Build your application for production: ng build --prod
This will remove all console.log statements from your code during the build process, so they will not appear in the final build.

## [Angular] What is the lifecycle for an angular app development?

The lifecycle of an Angular app development can be broken down into several stages:

```dos
Planning: This stage involves defining the scope of your application, identifying user requirements, and creating a project plan. You may also need to decide on the architecture and design of your application during this stage.

Development: This stage involves building the application using Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. You will need to create components, services, and modules that will make up your application. You may also need to use external libraries and APIs to add additional functionality to your application.

Testing: This stage involves writing and running tests to ensure that your application is functioning correctly. You will need to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to test your application's functionality and performance.

Deployment: This stage involves deploying your application to a server or hosting provider. You may need to configure your application for production, set up a database, and perform other tasks to prepare your application for deployment.

Maintenance: This stage involves monitoring your application for issues, fixing bugs, and adding new features. You may need to perform regular updates and maintenance to keep your application up-to-date and secure.
```

Throughout the lifecycle of your Angular application, you will need to use various tools and technologies, including the Angular CLI, Git, and various testing frameworks. It's important to follow best practices and industry standards to ensure that your application is robust, reliable, and scalable.

## [Angular] Angular guard

Angular guards are used to protect routes in an Angular application. They are used to control access to certain routes based on certain criteria. A guard can be used to restrict access to a route if the user is not authenticated, does not have the correct role, or if some other condition is not met.

There are several types of guards available in Angular:

```dos
CanActivate: This guard is used to determine if a user is allowed to activate a particular route. It can be used to restrict access to certain routes if the user is not authenticated or does not have the correct role.

CanActivateChild: This guard is similar to CanActivate, but it is used to determine if a user is allowed to activate the child routes of a particular route.

CanDeactivate: This guard is used to determine if a user is allowed to leave a particular route. It can be used to prevent the user from navigating away from a page if there is unsaved data.

CanLoad: This guard is used to determine if a user is allowed to load a particular module. It can be used to restrict access to certain modules if the user is not authenticated or does not have the correct role.
```

To use a guard in your Angular application, you can create a guard service and implement one of the guard interfaces mentioned above. Then you can add the guard to the route configuration in your app-routing.module.ts file.

## [Angular] Angular data binding

Angular data binding is a powerful feature that allows you to connect your application's data model to your user interface. There are three types of data binding in Angular:

Interpolation: This type of data binding allows you to display the value of a property or expression in your template. To use interpolation, simply surround the property or expression with double curly braces ({{ }}).

Property binding: This type of data binding allows you to set the value of a property on a DOM element. To use property binding, use square brackets ([ ]) to surround the property name.

Event binding: This type of data binding allows you to respond to user events such as clicks, keystrokes, and mouse movements. To use event binding, use parentheses (()) to surround the event name and the name of the method that should be called when the event is triggered.

Here's an example of how data binding works in Angular:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <input [value]="inputValue" (input)="onInputChange($event.target.value)">
    <p>You entered: {{inputValue}}</p>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Data Binding Example';
  inputValue = '';

  onInputChange(value: string) {
    this.inputValue = value;
  }
}
```

In this example, we have an ExampleComponent with a title property and an inputValue property. The title property is displayed using interpolation in an h1 tag. The inputValue property is bound to the value attribute of an input element using property binding. The inputValue property is also displayed using interpolation in a p tag. When the user types into the input, the onInputChange method is called using event binding. This method updates the inputValue property, which causes the value displayed in the p tag to be updated as well.

## [Angular] Angular property binding

Angular property binding is a way to set the value of a property on a DOM element. It allows you to dynamically update the properties of an element based on changes in your application's data model.

To use property binding in Angular, you need to use square brackets ([]) to surround the property name. Inside the brackets, you can provide an expression that evaluates to the value you want to set the property to. Here's an example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <h1 [innerHTML]="title"></h1>
    <img [src]="imageUrl" [alt]="imageAlt">
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Property Binding Example';
  imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
  imageAlt = 'Example Image';
}
```

In this example, we have an ExampleComponent with a title property, an imageUrl property, and an imageAlt property. We use property binding to set the innerHTML property of an h1 tag to the value of the title property. We also use property binding to set the src and alt attributes of an img tag to the values of the imageUrl and imageAlt properties, respectively.

You can also use property binding to set the value of any property on any element, including custom elements and Angular components. Just surround the property name with square brackets and provide an expression that evaluates to the value you want to set the property to.

## [Angular] Angular Event binding

Event binding in Angular allows you to listen for and respond to user events such as clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements. Here's how it works:

Choose an event: Decide which event you want to listen for. For example, you might want to listen for a button click event.

Bind to the event: In your component's HTML template, add an event binding to the element you want to listen for the event on. The syntax is (event)="expression". For example:

`<button (click)="handleButtonClick()">Click me</button>`

Define the event handler: In your component class, define a method to handle the event. This method should have the same name as the expression you used in the event binding. For example:

```javascript
handleButtonClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}
```

Respond to the event: In the event handler method, you can write code to respond to the event. For example, you might update a variable, call a function, or navigate to a different page.
Overall, event binding is a powerful tool in Angular that allows you to create dynamic and interactive web applications. By listening for user events and responding to them, you can create a rich user experience that engages your users and keeps them coming back.

## [Angular] Angular directive

In Angular, a directive is a class that adds behavior to an existing DOM element or component. Directives allow you to extend the functionality of HTML and create reusable code that can be applied to different elements and components.

There are three types of directives in Angular:

Component Directives: These are directives that create reusable UI components that can be used in different parts of the application. Components are a type of directive that can be inserted into the DOM and interact with other components and directives.

Structural Directives: These are directives that change the structure of the DOM by adding, removing, or manipulating elements. Examples of structural directives in Angular include *ngIf,*ngFor, and *ngSwitch.

Attribute Directives: These are directives that modify the behavior or appearance of an element by manipulating its attributes. Examples of attribute directives in Angular include ngClass, ngStyle, and ngModel.

Here's an example of how to create a custom attribute directive in Angular:

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[myHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(el: ElementRef) {
    el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a custom attribute directive called HighlightDirective that changes the background color of an element to yellow. We use the @Directive decorator to specify that this is a directive and provide a selector that matches the attribute we want to apply this directive to (in this case, [myHighlight]).

We then inject the ElementRef service into the constructor of the directive, which provides access to the underlying DOM element that the directive is attached to. We use this to set the backgroundColor style property of the element to yellow.

To use this directive in our template, we simply add the myHighlight attribute to an element:

`<p myHighlight>Highlight me!</p>`

This will apply the HighlightDirective to the p element, changing its background color to yellow.
