Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) and provides a comprehensive set of features for creating complex web applications.

AngularJS, on the other hand, is the predecessor of Angular and is an older version of the framework. AngularJS is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and uses JavaScript to build web applications, whereas Angular uses TypeScript.

The different components in Angular and their purpose are:

Component - It is the building block of Angular applications and defines a specific part of the user interface (UI).

Directive - It is used to add behavior to an existing DOM element or to create a new custom element.

Service - It is a singleton object that provides functionality to different parts of the application.

Pipe - It is used for formatting and transforming data in the UI.

Data binding in Angular refers to the automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view. There are four types of data binding in Angular:

Interpolation - It is used to display data in the view.

Property binding - It is used to set the value of an element property.

Event binding - It is used to respond to user events such as clicks and keystrokes.

Two-way binding - It is used to synchronize data between the model and the view.

A directive in Angular is a behavior that can be attached to an existing DOM element or used to create a new custom element. A component is a directive with a template.

A service in Angular is a singleton object that provides functionality to different parts of the application. Services can be injected into components and other services.

Dependency injection in Angular is a design pattern that allows objects to be loosely coupled and easily testable. It is used to provide dependencies to components and services.

Routing in Angular is a feature that allows navigation between different views in an application. It is implemented using the RouterModule.

To optimize Angular application performance, some of the best practices are:

Using lazy loading to load modules on demand.

Minimizing the number of HTTP requests.

Using AOT compilation.

Reducing the size of the application by using tree shaking and code splitting.

AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation in Angular is a process of compiling the application code at build time. JIT (Just in Time) compilation, on the other hand, compiles the application code at runtime. AOT compilation results in faster startup time and better performance.

The different lifecycle hooks in Angular are:

ngOnChanges - It is called when a data-bound property value changes.

ngOnInit - It is called when the component is initialized.

ngDoCheck - It is called during every change detection cycle.

ngOnDestroy - It is called when the component is about to be destroyed.

Form validation in Angular can be implemented using built-in validators or custom validators. Built-in validators include required, minlength, maxlength, and pattern. Custom validators can be created using the Validators class.

Pipes in Angular are used for formatting and transforming data in the UI. Pipes can be used to filter, sort, and transform data.

Error handling in Angular can be done using try-catch blocks, error handlers, and interceptors. Interceptors are used to intercept HTTP requests and responses and handle errors.

zone.js in Angular is a library that helps in managing asynchronous operations in Angular applications. It provides a way to track and manage the execution context of an application.

ngZone in Angular is a service that provides a way to execute code outside the Angular zone. This is useful for improving application performance and avoiding unnecessary change detection cycles.

## [Angular] 5 Angular interview questions

Questions

```dos
What is change detection in Angular and how does it work?
What is server-side rendering in Angular and how is it useful?
What are Angular elements and how are they used?
How do you implement lazy loading in Angular?
```

Answers

```dos
Change detection in Angular is the process of detecting changes in the application's data model and updating the view accordingly. Angular uses a mechanism called Zone.js to track changes in the application's data model and update the view. When a change occurs, Angular runs a change detection cycle to update the view. Change detection in Angular is a critical part of the framework and can impact the application's performance.

Server-side rendering (SSR) in Angular is the process of rendering the initial view of a web application on the server and sending it to the client's browser. This can improve the initial loading time of the application and improve search engine optimization (SEO) by providing a fully rendered HTML page to the search engine crawlers. Angular supports SSR using the Angular Universal library.

Angular Elements are a feature introduced in Angular 6 that allows developers to package Angular components as custom elements that can be used in non-Angular applications. Angular Elements allow developers to create reusable UI components that can be shared across multiple projects and platforms. Angular Elements are created using the @angular/elements package and can be used in any JavaScript application.

Lazy loading in Angular is a technique that allows developers to load specific parts of the application on demand, instead of loading the entire application at once. This can improve the initial loading time of the application and reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded. In Angular, lazy loading is implemented using the loadChildren method in the router configuration.
```

## [Angular] What are ng-content and ng-container in Angular and how are they used?

In Angular, ng-content and ng-container are directives that allow you to dynamically insert content into your templates.

ng-content is a directive that acts as a placeholder in a component's template. It is used to project the content that is defined outside of the component into the component's template. When ng-content is used in a component's template, the content that is defined between the component's opening and closing tags is inserted into the template at the location where ng-content is defined.

For example, suppose you have a component called app-card that represents a card UI element. You can use ng-content to allow users of the component to define the content of the card by passing it in from the parent component's template:

```html
<app-card>
  <h2>Card Title</h2>
  <p>Card Description</p>
</app-card>
```

In this example, the content between the app-card tags is passed into the app-card component's template using ng-content.

ng-container is another directive that is used to group content together in a template without creating any additional HTML elements. It is often used to group together multiple ng-content directives or to conditionally render content.

For example, suppose you have a component called app-layout that represents the layout of a page. You can use ng-container to group together the header, content, and footer of the page:

```html
<app-layout>
  <ng-container header>
    <app-header></app-header>
  </ng-container>
  <ng-container content>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  </ng-container>
  <ng-container footer>
    <app-footer></app-footer>
  </ng-container>
</app-layout>
```

In this example, ng-container is used to group together the header, content, and footer of the app-layout component. The header, content, and footer attributes are used to differentiate between the different groups of content.

## [Angular] What common ng commands do we use in an Angular project?

Here are some of the most common ng commands used in an Angular project:

```dos
ng new [project-name] - creates a new Angular project with the given name.
ng serve - compiles and serves the application in development mode, allowing you to view it in your browser at http://localhost:4200/.
ng build - compiles the application into an output directory that can be deployed to a server.
ng generate component [component-name] - generates a new component with the given name.
ng generate service [service-name] - generates a new service with the given name.
ng test - runs unit tests for the application.
ng lint - runs linting checks on the application's code.
ng update - updates the Angular dependencies in the project to the latest versions.
ng add [package-name] - adds a new package to the project, such as a third-party library or tool.
```

These are some of the most commonly used ng commands, but there are many others available as well. You can get a full list of available commands by running ng help or ng --help.

## [Angular] Angular lifecycle

Angular has a number of lifecycle hooks that allow you to tap into various stages of a component or directive's lifecycle, and execute custom logic at those stages. Here are the most commonly used Angular lifecycle hooks in the order they are called:

```dos
ngOnChanges: This hook is called when the input properties of a component change. It receives a SimpleChanges object that contains information about each changed property.

ngOnInit: This hook is called once, after the first ngOnChanges call, when the component is initialized. It is a good place to perform initialization logic.

ngDoCheck: This hook is called every time Angular checks for changes. It is a good place to perform custom change detection logic.

ngAfterContentInit: This hook is called after Angular projects external content into a component's view. It is a good place to perform initialization logic that relies on external content.

ngAfterContentChecked: This hook is called every time Angular checks for changes in the content projected into a component. It is a good place to perform custom change detection logic on that content.

ngAfterViewInit: This hook is called after Angular initializes a component's view and child views. It is a good place to perform initialization logic that relies on the component's view and child views.

ngAfterViewChecked: This hook is called every time Angular checks for changes in a component's view and child views. It is a good place to perform custom change detection logic on that view.

ngOnDestroy: This hook is called just before a component is destroyed. It is a good place to perform any cleanup logic, such as unsubscribing from observables or clearing timers.
```

By using these lifecycle hooks, you can execute custom logic at various stages of a component's or directive's lifecycle, which can be useful for a wide range of use cases, such as managing state, handling events, and performing initialization and cleanup tasks.

## [Angular] Angular @Input

In Angular, @Input() is a decorator that is used to define an input property for a component. An input property is a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

To use @Input(), you need to import it from the @angular/core module and add it before the input property you want to define. For example:

```angular
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>{{ inputData }}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() inputData: string;
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a child component called ChildComponent with an input property called inputData. The @Input() decorator is used to mark inputData as an input property.

To use this input property in the parent component, you need to bind it to a property in the parent component. For example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    <app-child [inputData]="parentData"></app-child>
  `
})
export class ParentComponent {
  parentData = 'This is the data passed from the parent component.';
}
```

In the above example, we have a parent component called ParentComponent that passes a value to the inputData input property of the ChildComponent using property binding. The value of parentData in the parent component is passed to the inputData input property in the child component.

## [Angular] Angular ng-style

In Angular, ngStyle is a directive that allows you to dynamically set CSS styles on an element based on the state of your component. With ngStyle, you can apply styles based on certain conditions, making your UI more dynamic.

To use ngStyle, you need to bind it to a property in your component that returns an object of CSS styles. For example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div [ngStyle]="{ 'color': textColor, 'background-color': bgColor }">
      This text has dynamically set styles!
    </div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  textColor = 'red';
  bgColor = 'yellow';
}
```

In the above example, we have a component called MyComponent that uses ngStyle to set the color and background-color styles of a div element. The styles are defined in an object that is bound to the ngStyle directive. The textColor and bgColor properties in the component define the values for the styles.

You can also use ngStyle to conditionally apply styles based on the state of your component. For example:

```angular
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <div [ngStyle]="{ 'color': isActive ? 'green' : 'red', 'text-decoration': isActive ? 'underline' : 'none' }">
      This text has dynamically set styles!
    </div>
    <button (click)="toggleActive()">Toggle Active</button>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  isActive = false;

  toggleActive() {
    this.isActive = !this.isActive;
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have a component called MyComponent that uses ngStyle to conditionally apply styles to a div element based on the value of the isActive property. When isActive is true, the text color is green and the text has an underline. When isActive is false, the text color is red and the text has no underline. The toggleActive method is called when a button is clicked and toggles the value of isActive.

## [Angular] Why we need a constructor in Angular?

In Angular, a constructor is used to create an instance of a component, directive, or service. It is a special method that gets called when an object of a class is created.

Here are some reasons why we need a constructor in Angular:

```dos
Dependency injection: The constructor is used to inject dependencies into a component or service. Angular provides a dependency injection system that allows us to declare the dependencies of a component or service in the constructor, and then Angular injects them automatically when an instance is created. This helps to decouple the code and make it more modular and testable.

Initializing properties: The constructor is used to initialize the properties of a component or service. It is often used to set default values or to initialize variables that are needed throughout the component or service.

Lifecycle hooks: The constructor is used to register lifecycle hooks for a component or directive. Lifecycle hooks are methods that get called at specific points during the lifecycle of a component or directive, such as when it is created, destroyed, or updated.

Inheritance: The constructor is used to call the constructor of the base class when a derived class is created. This is necessary to inherit properties and methods from the base class.
```

In summary, the constructor is an important part of Angular because it is used to create an instance of a component or service, inject dependencies, initialize properties, register lifecycle hooks, and call the constructor of the base class.
