## [React] React interview questions

Here are some common React interview questions you might encounter:

What is React and why is it popular?
Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's popular because it allows developers to create complex web applications with ease by providing a component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and a declarative approach to programming.

What is the difference between props and state in React?
Answer: Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, while state is used to manage data within a component. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component, while state can be modified by the component itself.

Explain the concept of virtual DOM in React.
Answer: The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained by React. When changes are made to the state of a component, React updates the virtual DOM, calculates the differences between the old and new virtual DOM, and then updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM to reflect the changes.

What is JSX in React?
Answer: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript code. It makes it easier to create and manipulate DOM elements in React.

What are React hooks?
Answer: React hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features without having to write class components. Some popular hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer.

What is the role of the componentDidMount() method in React?
Answer: The componentDidMount() method is a lifecycle method in React that is called after a component has been mounted to the DOM. It is often used to make API calls and to initialize state.

What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
Answer: Controlled components are React components that have their state controlled by React, while uncontrolled components have their state managed by the DOM. Controlled components are more powerful and flexible, but require more code to implement.
