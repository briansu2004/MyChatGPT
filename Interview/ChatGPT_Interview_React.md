## [React] React interview questions

Here are some common React interview questions you might encounter:

```dos
What is React and why is it popular?
Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's popular because it allows developers to create complex web applications with ease by providing a component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and a declarative approach to programming.

What is JSX in React?
Answer: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript code. It makes it easier to create and manipulate DOM elements in React.

What is a component in React?
A component is a reusable piece of UI that can be composed together to create more complex UIs. In React, components can be either class-based or functional.

What is the difference between props and state in React?
Answer: Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, while state is used to manage data within a component. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component, while state can be modified by the component itself.

What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
Answer: Controlled components are React components that have their state controlled by React, while uncontrolled components have their state managed by the DOM. Controlled components are more powerful and flexible, but require more code to implement.

What is the lifecycle of a React component?
React components go through several lifecycle phases, including mounting, updating, and unmounting. During each phase, different methods can be called to update the component or handle different events.

What is Redux and how does it work with React?
Redux is a state management library that is often used with React. It provides a centralized store for application state and allows components to update the store and subscribe to changes. This can make it easier to manage complex application state.

What are React hooks?
Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a way to reuse stateful logic and reduce the need for class components.

What is server-side rendering in React?
Server-side rendering is the process of rendering React components on the server instead of the client. This can improve performance and make the application more accessible to search engines.

How do you optimize the performance of a React application?
There are several techniques for optimizing the performance of a React application, including using shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-renders, using React.memo to memoize components, and implementing code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page. Other techniques include using server-side rendering and optimizing the network and database queries.

Explain the concept of virtual DOM in React.
Answer: The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained by React. When changes are made to the state of a component, React updates the virtual DOM, calculates the differences between the old and new virtual DOM, and then updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM to reflect the changes.

What is the role of the componentDidMount() method in React?
Answer: The componentDidMount() method is a lifecycle method in React that is called after a component has been mounted to the DOM. It is often used to make API calls and to initialize state.
