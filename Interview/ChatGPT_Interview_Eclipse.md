## [Eclipse] Can you explain the difference between a breakpoint and a watchpoint in Eclipse?

Yes, in Eclipse, a breakpoint and a watchpoint are two different debugging mechanisms used to inspect the state of a running program. Here's how they differ:

Breakpoint: A breakpoint is a debugging mechanism used to pause the execution of a program at a specific line of code. When the program reaches the line where the breakpoint is set, it will pause execution, and you can inspect the current state of the program at that point. You can use breakpoints to step through code, evaluate expressions, and modify variables.

Watchpoint: A watchpoint is a debugging mechanism used to pause the execution of a program when a specific variable is read from or written to. When a watchpoint is set on a variable, Eclipse will monitor every access to that variable and pause execution whenever it is accessed. You can use a watchpoint to investigate how and when a variable's value is changing during program execution.

In summary, breakpoints are used to pause program execution at a specific point in the code, while watchpoints are used to pause program execution when a specific variable is accessed. Both are useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues in your code.
