## [Git] For my GitHub project, I want to squash all the commits. How do I do that?

To squash all the commits in your GitHub project, you can follow these steps:

```dos
First, make sure you are on the branch that you want to squash the commits on.

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory.

Run the command git rebase -i HEAD~n, where "n" is the number of commits you want to squash. This will open up an interactive rebase window.

In the interactive rebase window, change the word "pick" to "squash" or "s" for all the commits that you want to squash.

Save and close the interactive rebase window.

You may need to resolve any merge conflicts that arise during the rebase process.

Once the rebase process is complete, use the command git push --force to push the changes to your repository.
```

Note: Squashing commits will rewrite your Git history, so use caution when doing this on shared branches. It's generally a good practice to create a new branch before squashing commits to avoid any unintended changes to the history.

## [Git] How to squash the commits for my Github repo?

To squash commits in your Github repository, you can follow these steps:

Open your terminal and navigate to the repository you want to squash commits for.
Create a new branch for your changes if you haven't already done so:

`git checkout -b new_branch_name`

Use the following command to squash your commits:

`git rebase -i HEAD~n`

Replace n with the number of commits you want to squash. This will open an interactive rebase editor where you can edit the commit history.

In the interactive rebase editor, replace the word pick with squash or s for each commit you want to squash.

Save and close the editor.

Git will prompt you to edit the commit message for the new, squashed commit. Edit the message as needed and save it.

Push the changes to the remote repository:

`git push origin new_branch_name --force`

Note: using --force is required when rewriting commit history as it replaces the old commits with the new, squashed commit.

Your commits have now been squashed into a single commit in your repository.
