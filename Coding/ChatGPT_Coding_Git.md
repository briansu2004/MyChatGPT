## [Git] For my GitHub project, I want to squash all the commits. How do I do that?

To squash all the commits in your GitHub project, you can follow these steps:

```dos
First, make sure you are on the branch that you want to squash the commits on.

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory.

Run the command git rebase -i HEAD~n, where "n" is the number of commits you want to squash. This will open up an interactive rebase window.

In the interactive rebase window, change the word "pick" to "squash" or "s" for all the commits that you want to squash.

Save and close the interactive rebase window.

You may need to resolve any merge conflicts that arise during the rebase process.

Once the rebase process is complete, use the command git push --force to push the changes to your repository.
```

Note: Squashing commits will rewrite your Git history, so use caution when doing this on shared branches. It's generally a good practice to create a new branch before squashing commits to avoid any unintended changes to the history.

## [Git] How to squash the commits for my Github repo?

To squash commits in your Github repository, you can follow these steps:

Open your terminal and navigate to the repository you want to squash commits for.
Create a new branch for your changes if you haven't already done so:

`git checkout -b new_branch_name`

Use the following command to squash your commits:

`git rebase -i HEAD~n`

Replace n with the number of commits you want to squash. This will open an interactive rebase editor where you can edit the commit history.

In the interactive rebase editor, replace the word pick with squash or s for each commit you want to squash.

Save and close the editor.

Git will prompt you to edit the commit message for the new, squashed commit. Edit the message as needed and save it.

Push the changes to the remote repository:

`git push origin new_branch_name --force`

Note: using --force is required when rewriting commit history as it replaces the old commits with the new, squashed commit.

Your commits have now been squashed into a single commit in your repository.

## [Git] I don't understand the differences `git config --local user.email`, `git config --global user.email`, `git config --system user.email` and `git config --worktree user.email`

git config is a command used to set and view configuration options for Git. It can be used to configure options at various levels, including system, global, local, and worktree. Here's a brief overview of what each of these levels means:

--system - This level applies to all users on the system and is typically used for setting default options for all repositories on the system.

--global - This level applies to the current user and is typically used for setting default options for all repositories for that user.

--local - This level applies to the current repository and is typically used for setting options specific to that repository.

--worktree - This level applies to a specific worktree within a repository and is typically used for setting options specific to that worktree.

Now, let's take a closer look at the user.email configuration option:

git config --system user.email sets the default email address for all Git repositories on the system. This is useful if you have multiple users on the same system and want to set a default email address for all users.

git config --global user.email sets the default email address for all Git repositories for the current user. This is useful if you have multiple repositories on your local machine and want to use the same email address for all of them.

git config --local user.email sets the email address for the current repository only. This is useful if you work on multiple projects and want to use a different email address for each one.

git config --worktree user.email sets the email address for a specific worktree within a repository. This is useful if you have multiple worktrees within a single repository and want to use a different email address for each one.

In summary, the --system, --global, --local, and --worktree flags in git config allow you to set configuration options at different levels, and user.email is an option that allows you to set the email address associated with your Git commits at each of these levels.
