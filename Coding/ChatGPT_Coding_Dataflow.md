## [Dataflow] GCP dataflow python example

Sure, here's an example of how to use GCP Dataflow with Python:

Let's say we have a CSV file containing a list of transactions, and we want to use Dataflow to calculate the total amount spent per customer:

First, we need to create a new Dataflow pipeline using the apache_beam Python package:
python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    # pipeline logic goes here
Next, we need to read the CSV file and convert it into a PCollection:
python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
In this code, we use the ReadFromText function to read the CSV file from a GCS bucket, and then we use Map transforms to split each line into fields, convert the amount field to a float, and convert the fields into a Python dictionary.

Now we can group the transactions by customer ID and calculate the total amount spent per customer:
less
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
    totals = (transactions
              | 'GroupByCustomer' >> beam.GroupBy(lambda transaction: transaction['customer_id'])
              | 'CalculateTotals' >> beam.Map(lambda kv: {
                  'customer_id': kv[0],
                  'total': sum(transaction['amount'] for transaction in kv[1])
              }))
In this code, we use the GroupBy transform to group the transactions by customer ID, and then we use Map to calculate the total amount spent per customer.

Finally, we can write the results to a BigQuery table:
less
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
    totals = (transactions
              | 'GroupByCustomer' >> beam.GroupBy(lambda transaction: transaction['customer_id'])
              | 'CalculateTotals' >> beam.Map(lambda kv: {
                  'customer_id': kv[0],
                  'total': sum(transaction['amount'] for transaction in kv[1])
              }))
    totals | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
        'project-id:dataset.table',
        schema='customer_id:STRING,total:FLOAT',
        write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE,
        create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED
    )
In this code, we use the WriteToBigQuery transform to write the results to a BigQuery table.

This is just a basic example, but Dataflow can handle much more complex data processing tasks. The `apache
