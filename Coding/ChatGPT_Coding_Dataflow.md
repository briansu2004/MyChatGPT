# Coding with ChatGPT - Dataflow

## [Dataflow] GCP dataflow python example

Sure, here's an example of how to use GCP Dataflow with Python:

Let's say we have a CSV file containing a list of transactions, and we want to use Dataflow to calculate the total amount spent per customer:

First, we need to create a new Dataflow pipeline using the apache_beam Python package:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    # pipeline logic goes here
```

Next, we need to read the CSV file and convert it into a PCollection:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
```

In this code, we use the ReadFromText function to read the CSV file from a GCS bucket, and then we use Map transforms to split each line into fields, convert the amount field to a float, and convert the fields into a Python dictionary.

Now we can group the transactions by customer ID and calculate the total amount spent per customer:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
    totals = (transactions
              | 'GroupByCustomer' >> beam.GroupBy(lambda transaction: transaction['customer_id'])
              | 'CalculateTotals' >> beam.Map(lambda kv: {
                  'customer_id': kv[0],
                  'total': sum(transaction['amount'] for transaction in kv[1])
              }))
```

In this code, we use the GroupBy transform to group the transactions by customer ID, and then we use Map to calculate the total amount spent per customer.

Finally, we can write the results to a BigQuery table:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
    totals = (transactions
              | 'GroupByCustomer' >> beam.GroupBy(lambda transaction: transaction['customer_id'])
              | 'CalculateTotals' >> beam.Map(lambda kv: {
                  'customer_id': kv[0],
                  'total': sum(transaction['amount'] for transaction in kv[1])
              }))
    totals | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
        'project-id:dataset.table',
        schema='customer_id:STRING,total:FLOAT',
        write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE,
        create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED
    )
```

In this code, we use the WriteToBigQuery transform to write the results to a BigQuery table.

This is just a basic example, but Dataflow can handle much more complex data processing tasks.

## [Dataflow] GCP dataflow python example (re)

Sure, here's an example of how to create a Google Cloud Dataflow job in Python:

```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

# Define the PipelineOptions

options = PipelineOptions()

# Define the pipeline

with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:

# Read data from a file

  lines = p | beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://my-bucket/input.txt')

# Transform the data

  words = lines | beam.FlatMap(lambda x: x.split(' '))

# Count the words

  word_counts = words | beam.combiners.Count.PerElement()

# Write the results to a file

  word_counts | beam.io.WriteToText('gs://my-bucket/output.txt')
```

In this example, we are reading data from a file located in a Google Cloud Storage bucket (gs://my-bucket/input.txt), splitting the lines into words, counting the occurrences of each word, and writing the results to another file in the same bucket (gs://my-bucket/output.txt).

To run this pipeline, you can use the following command:

```python
python my_pipeline.py --runner DataflowRunner --project my-project --region us-central1 --temp_location gs://my-bucket/tmp --staging_location gs://my-bucket/staging --job_name my-job
```

This command specifies the Dataflow runner, the GCP project to run the job in, the region to run the job in, and the locations for the temporary and staging files. The --job_name option specifies a name for the job, which must be unique within the project.

Note that you will need to have the necessary permissions and credentials set up to run Dataflow jobs in GCP. You can find more information about setting up Dataflow and running jobs in the GCP documentation.
