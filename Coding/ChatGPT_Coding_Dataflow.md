## [Dataflow] GCP dataflow python example

Sure, here's an example of how to use GCP Dataflow with Python:

Let's say we have a CSV file containing a list of transactions, and we want to use Dataflow to calculate the total amount spent per customer:

First, we need to create a new Dataflow pipeline using the apache_beam Python package:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    # pipeline logic goes here
```

Next, we need to read the CSV file and convert it into a PCollection:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
```

In this code, we use the ReadFromText function to read the CSV file from a GCS bucket, and then we use Map transforms to split each line into fields, convert the amount field to a float, and convert the fields into a Python dictionary.

Now we can group the transactions by customer ID and calculate the total amount spent per customer:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
    totals = (transactions
              | 'GroupByCustomer' >> beam.GroupBy(lambda transaction: transaction['customer_id'])
              | 'CalculateTotals' >> beam.Map(lambda kv: {
                  'customer_id': kv[0],
                  'total': sum(transaction['amount'] for transaction in kv[1])
              }))
```

In this code, we use the GroupBy transform to group the transactions by customer ID, and then we use Map to calculate the total amount spent per customer.

Finally, we can write the results to a BigQuery table:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    transactions = (pipeline
                    | 'ReadTransactions' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket/transactions.csv')
                    | 'ParseTransactions' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
                    | 'ConvertToDict' >> beam.Map(lambda fields: {
                        'customer_id': fields[0],
                        'amount': float(fields[1])
                    }))
    totals = (transactions
              | 'GroupByCustomer' >> beam.GroupBy(lambda transaction: transaction['customer_id'])
              | 'CalculateTotals' >> beam.Map(lambda kv: {
                  'customer_id': kv[0],
                  'total': sum(transaction['amount'] for transaction in kv[1])
              }))
    totals | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
        'project-id:dataset.table',
        schema='customer_id:STRING,total:FLOAT',
        write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE,
        create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED
    )
```

In this code, we use the WriteToBigQuery transform to write the results to a BigQuery table.

This is just a basic example, but Dataflow can handle much more complex data processing tasks.

## [Dataflow] GCP dataflow python example (re)

Sure, here's an example of how to create a Google Cloud Dataflow job in Python:

```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

# Define the PipelineOptions

options = PipelineOptions()

# Define the pipeline

with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:

# Read data from a file

  lines = p | beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://my-bucket/input.txt')

# Transform the data

  words = lines | beam.FlatMap(lambda x: x.split(' '))

# Count the words

  word_counts = words | beam.combiners.Count.PerElement()

# Write the results to a file

  word_counts | beam.io.WriteToText('gs://my-bucket/output.txt')
```

In this example, we are reading data from a file located in a Google Cloud Storage bucket (gs://my-bucket/input.txt), splitting the lines into words, counting the occurrences of each word, and writing the results to another file in the same bucket (gs://my-bucket/output.txt).

To run this pipeline, you can use the following command:

```python
python my_pipeline.py --runner DataflowRunner --project my-project --region us-central1 --temp_location gs://my-bucket/tmp --staging_location gs://my-bucket/staging --job_name my-job
```

This command specifies the Dataflow runner, the GCP project to run the job in, the region to run the job in, and the locations for the temporary and staging files. The --job_name option specifies a name for the job, which must be unique within the project.

Note that you will need to have the necessary permissions and credentials set up to run Dataflow jobs in GCP. You can find more information about setting up Dataflow and running jobs in the GCP documentation.

## [Dataflow] GCP dataflow python example (3rd)

Sure, here's an example of how to use Google Cloud Dataflow in Python:

Let's say we have a CSV file stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, and we want to read the file, transform the data, and write the output to a new file in the same bucket.

First, we need to create a new Python file and import the necessary modules:

```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromText, WriteToText
```

Next, we need to define a Dataflow pipeline:

```python
with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    # Read the CSV file from Cloud Storage
    lines = pipeline | 'Read from GCS' >> ReadFromText('gs://my-bucket/input.csv')

    # Transform the data using a ParDo function
    transformed = (
        lines
        | 'Transform data' >> beam.ParDo(MyTransform())
    )

    # Write the output to a new file in Cloud Storage
    transformed | 'Write to GCS' >> WriteToText('gs://my-bucket/output.txt')
```

In this example, we are using the ReadFromText and WriteToText methods to read and write data to a Cloud Storage bucket. We are also using a ParDo function called MyTransform to transform the data.

Here's an example implementation of the MyTransform function:

```python
class MyTransform(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        # Split the CSV line into fields
        fields = element.split(',')

        # Extract the relevant fields
        name = fields[0]
        age = int(fields[1])
        gender = fields[2]

        # Convert the data to a dictionary
        data = {'name': name, 'age': age, 'gender': gender}

        # Return the transformed data
        return [data]
```

In this function, we are splitting each CSV line into fields, extracting the relevant fields, converting the data to a dictionary, and returning the transformed data.

Finally, we can run the Dataflow pipeline using the python command:

```dos
python my_pipeline.py --runner DataflowRunner --project my-project --region us-central1 --staging_location gs://my-bucket/staging --temp_location gs://my-bucket/temp --job_name my-job
```

This command will run the Dataflow pipeline using the DataflowRunner, and will create a new job with the name my-job. The --project, --region, --staging_location, and --temp_location options are used to configure the Dataflow job.

## [Dataflow] How to use python to create a GCP dataflow to load csv file from GCS bucket to BigQuery table?

Sure, here's an example of how to use Python to create a Google Cloud Dataflow pipeline to load a CSV file from a GCS bucket to a BigQuery table:

First, we need to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install apache-beam[gcp]==2.31.0 google-cloud-bigquery==2.31.0
```

Next, we need to import the necessary modules:

```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromText
from apache_beam.io.gcp.bigquery_tools import parse_table_schema_from_json
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions
from apache_beam.options.value_provider import StaticValueProvider
from google.cloud import bigquery
```

Then, we need to define a function to create the BigQuery table schema:

```python
def create_table_schema():
    schema_json = """
    [
        {"name": "name", "type": "STRING"},
        {"name": "age", "type": "INTEGER"},
        {"name": "gender", "type": "STRING"}
    ]
    """
    return parse_table_schema_from_json(schema_json)
```

In this example, we are defining a schema for a table with three columns: name, age, and gender.

Next, we need to define a Dataflow pipeline:

```python
def run(argv=None):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--input', dest='input', required=True, help='Input file to process.')
    parser.add_argument('--output', dest='output', required=True, help='Output BigQuery table to write results to.')
    parser.add_argument('--project', dest='project', required=True, help='Google Cloud project ID.')
    parser.add_argument('--temp_location', dest='temp_location', required=True, help='Temporary location for Dataflow.')
    parser.add_argument('--runner', dest='runner', required=True, help='Dataflow runner to use.')
    known_args, pipeline_args = parser.parse_known_args(argv)
    options = PipelineOptions(pipeline_args)
    with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        # Read the CSV file from GCS
        lines = p | 'ReadFromText' >> ReadFromText(known_args.input)

        # Transform the data
        transformed = lines | 'TransformData' >> beam.Map(parse_csv)

        # Write the output to BigQuery
        transformed | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
            known_args.output,
            schema=create_table_schema(),
            create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED,
            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE,
            project=StaticValueProvider(str, known_args.project),
            temp_location=StaticValueProvider(str, known_args.temp_location)
        )
```

In this example, we are using the ReadFromText method to read the CSV file from a GCS bucket. We are then using a Map transformation to parse the CSV data and convert it to a dictionary. Finally, we are using the WriteToBigQuery method to write the data to a BigQuery table.

Here's an example implementation of the parse_csv function:

```python
def parse_csv(row):
    name, age, gender = row.split(',')
    return {'name': name, 'age': int(age), 'gender': gender}
```

In this function, we are splitting each CSV row into fields, converting the age field to an integer, and returning a dictionary containing the data.

Finally, we can run the Dataflow pipeline using the following command:

```bash
python my_pipeline.py \
--input gs://my-bucket/input.csv \
--output my-project:my_dataset
```
